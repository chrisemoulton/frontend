Pay off part of your mortgage? Buy a new kitchen? Give yourself that luxury bathroom you always promised yourself?\r\nWell, now is your chance. <P>Jobs & Money, in association with The MarketPlace at Bradford & Bingley, is  offering readers the opportunity to win a tax-free £7,000 cash lump sum. Bradford & Bingley will also offer the winning reader a no-strings consultation with one of their independent mortgage consultants. <P>\r\nEntering the draw is simple. All you have to do is ring 0800 113 333 or enter online. Just go to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money\" target=\"_new\"> guardian.co.uk/money</a> and enter the draw there.<P>\r\nThe results of our ICM poll this week reveal what most people would do if they won thousands of pounds in a competition. <P>\r\nA new kitchen was the most popular choice, picked by 28% of the 1,000 people polled by ICM. Younger people in particular were keenest to splash the cash on a kitchen makeover. <P>\r\nA conservatory was the next most popular choice, pushing a new extension into third place, followed by a new bathroom. And so much for Britain's obssession with gardening - a garden makeover was the least popular choice. <P>\r\nConservatories were most sought after by the 45-plus age group, while young families in the 35-44 age bracket were keenest on building an extension. \r\nPerhaps you will be the lucky winner of the £7,000 prize. But if you don't, and you are interested in advice on your mortgage,  then an independent expert may be able to help. Whether you are a first-time buyer, moving up the mortgage ladder, \r\nor simply seeking to refinance your mortgage, you can find information and factsheets online at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money\" target=\"_new\"> guardian.co.uk/money</a>. <P>But you cannot win the £7,000 unless you enter the draw.
