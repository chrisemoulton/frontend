<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> leader, a lifelong republican, took part in the Buckingham Palace ceremony to become a member of the ceremonial body, which enables him to receive confidential security briefings.</p> <p>Labour said Corbyn complied with the usual processes, which tend to involve kneeling on a stool before kissing the Queen’s hand.</p> <p>But it is understood Buckingham Palace does not force privy council members to do things they are not comfortable with and that Corbyn did not kneel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image

Queen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Cuthbert/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking to ITV News before the ceremony, Corbyn signalled he would not be kneeling. “I don’t expect to be kneeling at all, no,” he said. “I expect to be nominated to the privy council and that’s it.”</p> <p>Corbyn had initially indicated he would have to think about whether to take part in the ceremony, saying there were “some things that ought to change in our society and maybe that’s one of them”.</p> <p>Last month he turned down the chance to be made a member of the privy council in person by the Queen, with his office saying that private engagements made such a ceremony impossible.</p> <p>There was speculation that he might try to become a member by an order in council, rather than attending in person, but he travelled to the palace on Wednesday to take part in the initiation rite at 5.30pm.</p> <p>It is possible, and indeed frequent, for members of the privy council to be appointed without meeting the monarch through a device known as an order in council, but would have been unusual for a party leader to use such a course.</p> <p>The Royal Encyclopaedia describes what the protocol involves: “The new privy counsellor or minister will extend his or her right hand, palm upwards, and, taking the Queen’s hand lightly, will kiss it with no more than a touch of the lips.”</p> <p>The late former cabinet minister and republican Tony Benn said in his diaries that he kissed his own thumb instead of the Queen’s hand.</p> <p>As well as that, new members are meant to swear to defend the monarch against “all foreign princes, persons, prelates, states or potentates”.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\"

member of the council, which is the oldest functioning legislative assembly in the UK, Corbyn now has the right to use right honourable as a title.</p> <p>The council is made up of 600 senior figures including politicians, which tends not to transact any serious business. Not many of its members turn up to meetings, which happen roughly once a month.</p> <p>Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock both became privy counsellors, which entitled them to security information and briefings they might otherwise have not been able to obtain.</p> <p>While MPs have to swear or affirm allegiance to the Queen, the oath required of privy council members is more extensive.</p> <p>The current wording, which has been around since Tudor times, states: “You will not know or understand of any manner of thing to be attempted, done or spoken against Her Majesty’s person, honour, crown or dignity royal, but you will let and withstand the same to the uttermost of your power, and either cause it to be revealed to Her Majesty herself, or to such of her privy council as shall advertise Her Majesty of the same.</p> <p>“You will in all things to be moved, treated and debated in council, faithfully and truly declare your mind and opinion, according to your heart and conscience; and will keep secret all matters committed and revealed unto you, or that shall be treated of secretly in council.”</p> <p>Since becoming Labour leader, Corbyn has come under intense criticism from some sections of the media over his participation in ceremonial events.<br /></p> <p>His critics have variously attacked him for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/08/jeremy-corbyn-cenotaph-bow-scrutinised-social-media-remembrance-sunday\">not bowing low enough at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday</a>, appearing not to sing the national anthem at a service and “snubbing” the Rugby World Cup opening ceremony by turning down an invitation to attend.</p> <p>Corbyn observed the two-minute silence for Armistice Day with children at a pre-school in Crawley, West Sussex, holding hands in a circle.

who performs under their own name, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/19/julia-holter-have-you-in-my-wilderness\">Julia Holter </a>does, to introduce the musicians in their backing band towards the end of a live set. It’s rare that they point to the sound man and introduce him, too, as Holter does with Ernst Hölscher. But that is typical of Holter’s ability to unsettle the ordinary; typical of the way her songs lurch into the unexpected, sending seemingly straightforward romantic tunes off-kilter and making jagged avant-classical compositions coalesce into neat pop.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2JgMniIpRM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2JgMniIpRM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for Feel You by Julia Holter</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Her appreciation of her sound engineer is typical, too, of the pristine nature of her music: glassy, pellucid, silvery as moonlight. There is such precision to it, such rigour, that her songs might be arranged following complex mathematical formulas. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2JgMniIpRM\">Feel You</a>, from her new album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/24/julia-holter-have-you-in-my-wilderness-review\">Have You in My Wilderness</a>, has a regular time signature but plays such a convoluted game of hopscotch with it that it’s hard to tell. Attempts to trace the rhythm of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wql7tG_jwJA\">Vasquez</a> are doomed to failure: drummer Corey Fogel prowls and leaps across the bar, Devin Hoff’s hands dance about the double bass, and Holter’s piano notes disregard both. The ease and grace with which they merge into a conventional 4/4 rhythm is startling; from there, the song becomes a sinuous lament, Dina Maccabee’s viola keening, Holter’s ululating vocal the cry of a muezzin calling the faithful to prayer.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1e75faca1a45f46e5e7972c91e48fed4dd24cb34\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1e75faca1a45f46e5e7972c91e48fed4dd24cb34/0_414_3037_3874/784.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Holter in Brighton on 9 November\" width=\"784\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Holter in Brighton on 9 November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tabatha Fireman/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without that element of mystery, of collusion with supernatural forces, Holter’s music might sound coolly austere: with it, it is magical. The sea is conjured up in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh0b2jI0iGg\">Lucette Stranded on the Island</a>, as viola and percussion sketch whirling gulls and shimmering waves, but so is something uncanny that builds up and crashes, as though watery spirits had answered Holter’s call. The viola that opens How Long is sticky as treacle, tendrils of it wrapping around Holter’s low intoned vocal and gnomic pronouncements. An older song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QukVgY8I_nA\">Marienbad</a>, clinks like a fortune-teller’s crystals; its notes are clear and pure, but its atmosphere is ominous.<br /></p> <p>The deepest mystery running through Holter’s songs is that of human relations, and just occasionally, the sound of them is one of simple delight. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzzpkDPetZU\">This Is a True Heart</a> is stylish as a French romance; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaaQw9Tw8rU\">Everytime Boots</a> skips along like a tune from a musical, until its perkiness is fractured and becomes clatter. Love might not be harmonious, but Holter’s marriage of modern classical with pop, jazz and everything in between certainly is.<br /></p> <ul> <li>At<a href=\"https://www.glee.co.uk/birmingham-music/#shows\"> Glee Club, Birmingham</a>, Wednesday 11 November.

href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamerlano\">Handel’s Tamerlano</a> has become a calling card for <a href=\"http://www.il-pomodoro.ch/orchestra/\">Il Pomo d’Oro</a>, the fine Italian period ensemble founded in 2012. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/08/tamerlano-handel-review-il-pomo-doro-riccardo-minasi\">Their recording</a> of this most difficult of the composer’s operas, released last year, was a great achievement, which, along with a series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/14/cencic-il-pomo-doro-minasi-review\">striking Wigmore Hall concerts</a>, put them very much on the map as far as UK audiences are concerned. Their Barbican debut performance of the piece, part of their current European tour, revealed, however, that something has unfortunately slipped in the interim.</p> <p>A change of conductor hasn’t helped. In place of the dynamic Riccardo<br />Minasi, we now have the young Russian <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://emelyanychevenglish.blogspot.co.uk/p/blog-page.html\">Maxim Emelyanychev</a>, graceful, almost balletic in his movements, and fascinating to watch. But he seems to think in the moment rather than in terms of dramatic span, and an awkward lack of cumulative momentum undermined the impact of a work that trawls, with insidious slowness, through the mind of a psychopath, chronicling the disastrous consequences of the games he plays with the lives of others. Some sluggish recitatives, and lengthy pauses to retune, further impeded the flow.</p> <p>The singing was variable, too. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4DpYgG3FyM\">Julia Lezhneva</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4DpYgG3FyM]%27s\">’s</a> Asteria, a newcomer to the cast, was unaccountably plagued by intonation and diction problems. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2SnqxbTwtY\">John Mark Ainsley</a>, as Tamerlano’s principal victim Bajazet, has been on better form, and his death scene didn’t quite move as it should. There were significant pluses, however. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLo8FsQe_U8\">Xavier Sabata</a>’<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLo8FsQe_U8]%27s\">s</a> Tamerlano remains one of the finest Handel operatic performances, outstandingly sung, waspishly characterised and dangerously attractive: you fully understand why his cast off fiancee, Irene (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScYv9GUHUqA\">Romina Basso</a>, oddly uncertain in her second aria, but wonderfully authoritative elsewhere), should still be in thrall to him. And <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAwjQbHZHXo\">Max Emanuel Cencic</a> sang with glorious beauty of tone as Andronico: this is such a great voice. A hit and miss evening, with remarkable moments, but sadly lacking cogency overall.

Both daughters of Loudon Wainwright III, and of mothers who sung with their own sisters (the late Kate McGarrigle in Martha’s case, Suzzy Roche in Lucy’s), their new joint LP, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_in_the_Dark_(album)\">Songs in the Dark</a>, is a lovely, twilit thing, full of lullabies, folk songs and covers sung to them as children.</p> <p>Not that their approach is sentimental, however. On Baby Rocking Medley, they offer wailing newborns up for adoption willingly, while on an arresting cover of Richard Thompson’s The End of the Rainbow (from the landmark 1974 folk album I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight), you really believe them telling a child “there’s nothing to grow up for anymore”.</p> <p>These performances are powerful because the sisters’ different voices create a strange magic together. Martha’s is girlish but also fleshy and sinewy, while Lucy’s rings out like a bright, clear bell. The combination gives songs such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/10/07/wainwright-sisters-el-condor-pasa/\">Simon and Garfunkel’s El Condor Pasa</a> an uncanny, eerie edge, and a sound far removed from the glossy polish of sibling bands such as the Staves.</p> <p>Chaos reigns tonight, too – there are more mangled guitar errors, before Arc appears from the vestry, wanders about, then disappears – but the sisters’ humour between songs makes everything very human. So much so that when Martha sings Lullaby for a Doll, written by her mother about a daughter who was growing up in her image, every note rings true.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10970245","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405113","internalRevision":"291","internalContentCode":"458367218","publication":"The

recent band, to mark the responsibility of older pioneers such as himself to protect the jazz past. But Corea is playful, so he treats this duty as a celebration of spontaneity, not a lecture, and a reinvention of earlier music in improv-driven real time. Two years ago, the Vigil made a tentative debut at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/06/chick-corea-vigil-review\">Ronnie Scott’s</a>, but a 2015 version adds the dynamic young rhythm-section pairing of Venezuelan percussionist <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.remo.com/portal/artists/5375/Luisito_Quintero.html\">Luisito Quintero</a> and Cuban bassist <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://carlitosdelpuerto.com/\">Carlitos del Puerto</a> – which jacks up the visceral excitement without swamping the creative space in which the 74-year-old Corea continues to thrive as one of jazz’s most inventively conversational piano improvisers.</p> <p>Corea took his time at the band’s first show at Ronnie Scott’s this week – noodling with the electric keys, hinting at hooks that didn’t arrive over stop-start patterns from kit-drummer Marcus Gilmore, or sampled hip-hop grooves. A skipping dance riff at the grand piano led into Corea’s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twpeayuE8EU\">Royalty</a>, mixing waltzing swing passages with reflective interludes in which the pianist, the powerful saxist and bass clarinettist Tim Garland, subtle guitarist Charles Altura, and the precisely fast-moving del Puerto would each tee themselves up for eventually vehement solos.</p> <p>Corea’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7PX_81AFKo\">Anna’s Tango</a>, written for his mother, unleashed bursts of tango flouncing that would stop dead just as the punters were starting to shake their shoulders. Tempus Fugit, a 1940s bebop classic by Corea’s early piano influence <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.allaboutjazz.com/the-amazing-bud-powell-black-genius-jazz-history-and-the-challenge-of-bebop-bud-powell-by-ian-patterson.php\">Bud Powell</a> unleashed a captivating stream of fresh melody from the leader, and a thrilling percussion climax of gleeful banter between Quintero and Gilmore. For the encore, Corea invited rising young British jazz star <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/03/jacob-collier-review-ronnie-scotts-jazz-new-messiah\">Jacob Collier</a> to jam with his melodica on a medley of Concierto de Aranjuez and Corea’s classic original Spain. Collier played discreetly and looked a little awed, but the elder statesman warmly embraced him as a hot recruit to the musical art of jumping in the deep end. </p> <ul> <li><em>Chick Corea and the

trying to scale the walls of the presidential palace in Kabul on Wednesday, as anger grew over the decapitation of seven civilians in southern Afghanistan by militants believed to be loyal to Islamic State.</p> <p>Officials said seven people had been injured when shots were fired into the air as thousands gathered in the Afghan capital to call for the resignation of the country’s president, Ashraf Ghani.</p> <p>In a sign of growing violence between the Taliban and self-proclaimed Isis militants, the decapitated bodies of seven Hazaras, a Shia minority, were found on Saturday in Zabul province. The victims had been taken hostage about a month ago on the road from Jaghori district in Ghazni province to Kandahar.</p> <p>The Hazaras have historically suffered persecution, and many protesters on Tuesday and Wednesday demanded an end to what they called targeted killings. “The government is not taking the protection of Hazaras seriously,” said Mohammad Jawad, 29.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/07/afghan-hazara-asylum-seekers-forcibly-deported-australia\">Afghan Hazara asylum seekers to be forcibly deported from Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the wake of the largest protests In Afghanistan since Ghani came to power last year, he addressed the nation in a televised speech on Wednesday. He encouraged people to calm their emotions, and promised that the government would not rest until the perpetrators had been punished. “The nation’s pain is my pain,” he said. </p> <p>He also tried to downplay the ethnic element of the killings, blaming the “enemies of Afghanistan” for trying to foment sectarian hatred.</p> <p>The demonstrations began on Tuesday when relatives of the victims brought the seven coffins to a Hazara neighbourhood in the capital. The coffins arrived in Kabul in the evening, draped in green cloth to the sound of wailing and thunderous shouts of “God is Great” from hundreds of mourners. One of the coffins, ferried on the hands of a group of crying women, carried nine-year-old Shukria, the youngest victim.</p> <p>Mourners beat their chests and chanted “death to the Taliban” and “death to Ashraf Ghani”. As the evening wore on, the families’ grief became collective and their private cries were transformed into broader demands for protection and justice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/29/afghan-exodus-grows-taliban-gain-ground-refugees\">Afghan exodus grows as Taliban gains ground and hope for future diminishes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By Wednesday, as the protesters marched on the palace, the crowds had swollen to many thousands, including members of other ethnic groups. A man said to be Shukria’s father banged his fists against the palace gates, and his head against his daughter’s coffin.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/06/farkhunda-malikzada-murder-protests-kabul-death-sentences-quashed\">As was the case after the March mob murder of Farkhunda Malikzada</a>, women were at the forefront of the demonstration. In addition to Shukria, two women were also among the victims. </p> <p>“Being a woman in Afghanistan is dangerous, but being Hazara is even more dangerous,” said Leila Mohammadi, 28, who helped carry the coffins. “These women were completely innocent,” she said.</p> <p>“There have been many incidents against women in Afghanistan,” said Maryam Shahi, another protester. “But nothing like these beheadings.”</p> <p>The demonstrations were comparable in size to the mass rallies during last year’s contentious election. As Afghanistan becomes increasingly unstable, disillusionment with the government is driving large numbers of young Afghans, many of them Hazaras, to seek a better life in Europe.</p> <p>For Hazaras, the brutality of the murders chime with traumatic memories of a violent past. They were often persecuted under the Taliban. In 2001, the Taliban executed several hundred Hazaras in Bamiyan, in one of the single worst incidents of targeted ethnic killings in recent Afghan memory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/05/iran-recruits-afghan-refugees-fight-save-syrias-bashar-al-assad\">Afghan refugees in Iran being sent to fight and die for Assad in Syria</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Travel has been particularly fraught with danger for Afghanistan’s Hazaras in recent years. People have been kidnapped and murdered on the country’s roads. “Kabul has become like a prison for us,” said Ali, a protester who only went by one name.</p> <p>Other protesters warned against fuelling sectarian tensions by focusing on the ethnic aspect of the killings.</p> <p>“Every day Daesh [Isis] and the Taliban kill,” said Mohammad Mustafa, 22, a Tajik university student. “Today does not belong just to the Hazaras. It belongs to all people in our country.”</p> <p>New splinter groups within the insurgency have pledged allegiance to Isis, but few if any have shown signs of links to the organisation in Iraq and Syria. They have, however, sought to match their namesakes in brutality.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Mokhtar

The reality is different.</p> <p>In 1983, Liverpool Labour inherited an appalling social and financial crisis. The defeated Liberal-Tory alliance had budgeted for 2,000 redundancies and unallocated cuts of £10m, about £25m in today’s money. Between 1977 and 1983, 60% of Liverpool’s manufacturing was destroyed; the docks industry had halved; council rents were the highest in the UK outside London. Heseltine had slashed £100m in grants from the council budget; 30,000 families were on the housing waiting list; not a single house for rent had been built by the council in the previous two years.</p> <p>We were elected on a programme of defending the city from further degradation and were proud to adopt the slogan of the jailed Poplar councillors that it was “better to break the law than break the poor”. We refused to implement cuts and clawed back funds cut from our budget to build houses, cancel redundancies, create jobs, and decisively improve the living standards of thousands. That is a record to be celebrated. If today’s “Labour” councillors emulated our stance, this current illegitimate government could be compelled to retreat.<br /><strong>Tony Mulhearn</strong><br /><em>Ex-councillor and Liverpool Labour president</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Join the debate – email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>","internalOctopusCode":"10969834","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405470","internalRevision":"16","internalContentCode":"458370196","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Letters:</strong> We refused to implement cuts and clawed back funds cut from our budget to build houses, cancel redundancies and create jobs","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Labour’s proud record in 1980s Liverpool","byline":"Letters","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T19:43:31Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/11/1447259162962/Liverpool-001.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56436a36e4b0ba7d62b0cf45","newspaperPageNumber":"44","creationDate":"2015-11-11T16:17:58Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T22:00:56.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/11/labours-proud-record-in-1980s-liverpool","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2015/nov/11/labours-proud-record-in-1980s-liverpool","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"386ccc7c1aada5725312e2508effa7811a6dcab1","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/11/1447259169412/Liverpool-005.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"The Guardian","picdarUrn":"PD*8383856","altText":"Liverpool","caption":"Liverpool, where Labour's 1980s record is one to be celebrated, according to Tony Mulhearn.

Hollywood’s gender pay gap, 10 November</a>). Now Kate Winslet reveals that she finds the entire conversation “vulgar” (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/11/kate-winslet-the-gender-pay-gap-debate-is-a-bit-vulgar\" title=\"\">Report, 11 November</a>). In some ways I agree with her, but my reasoning is different. I do believe it is despicable that actresses get paid so much less than their male counterparts and that this is an issue that deserves to be addressed. However, it does perturb me that women with such sway over the public conscience and such ability to raise awareness and effect change, use this power to discuss their own pay packets.</p> <p>Most of the actresses who have vocally denounced the gender pay gap could probably afford to lose a zero from their annual salary before having to give up their house or one of their cars. I understand this is not the point; men are getting paid more to do the same job. However, I wish they would use those moments, when the entire world is hanging on their every word, to talk about the women whose homes are put in jeopardy by the loss of a mere £20 a week. I believe that gender equality in every sense will come from below, not above. By bemoaning the dent that being female has effected in their multimillion-pound pay packets, actresses are merely perpetuating the notion that feminism is both bourgeois and out of touch. <br /><strong>Matilda Embling</strong><br /><em>London </em></p> <p>• This year’s Equal Pay Day fell on 9 November – marking the moment from which women are now working for free (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/09/gender-pay-gap-women-working-free-until-end-of-year\" title=\"\">Report, 9 November</a>). However, young women on apprenticeships have been working for free since 28 October, almost two weeks earlier (based on a similar calculation), because they earn 21% less than their male counterparts. The gender pay gap debate has focused on women over 40 in the professional world. But equal attention needs to be given to younger women, often in low-paid work, at the beginning of their careers.<br /><strong>Dr Carole Easton</strong><br /><em>Chief executive, Young Women’s Trust</em></p> <p>• Polly Toynbee cites a shocking High Pay Centre report which reveals that the average salary of chief executives is now £5m (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/joy-tax-scandanavian-services-us-tax-rates\" title=\"\">Report, 3 November</a>).

Modi is a democratically elected prime minister of the world’s largest democracy. Mishra and many like him have never come to terms with it. He claims that non-resident Indians, denied full dignity in a white man’s world, have hitched their low self-esteem to Modi mania. One wonders what Pankaj is doing in the white man’s land he despises. He should be in India challenging Modi, rather than criticising from the comfort of the UK.<br /><strong>Nitin Mehta</strong><br /><em>London</em> <br /><em>More views on Narendra Modi’s visit </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/on-his-uk-visit-narendra-modi-must-be-held-accountable-for-his-record-on-human-rights-in-india\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a></p> <p>• The nation is now richer by owning a Van Dyck painting (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/09/bowes-museum-van-dyck-portrait-major-acquisition-for-north\" title=\"\">Going public, 10 November</a>).

It could have built loads of new homes. Tax is levied to support the infrastructure of our society, to make it a good place to live; and the most privileged are, reasonably, asked to contribute proportionately more. <br /><strong>Barbara Crowther</strong><br /><em>Leamington, Warwickshire</em></p> <p>• TP Leary (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/06/heres-robot-peston-we-could-easily-automate-newsreaders\" title=\"\">Letters, 7 November</a>) scorns Lewes’s claim to be the biggest 5 November event in the world with the question, how many other countries celebrate Guy Fawkes? The answer is Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Caribbean. It’s a night whose stand for democracy over terror is seeing it win back adherence over the bland commercialism of Halloween. <br /><strong>Leo Schulz</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>• My Bayko building set in the 1930s gave me hours of enjoyment (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/10/bayko-what-about-arkitex-office-blocks\" title=\"\">Letters, 11 November</a>).

As it whipped around its star, completing an orbit every 1.6 days, it produced a faint 0.3% dip in the starlight picked up by the telescopes, according to a report in <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature15762\">Nature</a>.<br /></p> <p>The planet is tidally locked to its star, much as the moon is to Earth, and has one face in permanent daylight, the other in darkness. Given the world’s size and mass, researchers suspect it is rocky, like the inner planets of our solar system. It orbits 1.4m miles from its star, far closer than Mercury, which is never less than 36m miles from the sun.<br /></p> <p>Because the red dwarf is so small, and the planet is on such a close orbit, astronomers should find it fairly easy to detect and study any atmosphere the world has. The team has already requested time on the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes to observe the planet in more detail.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1mMNn495Ck\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h1mMNn495Ck?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>This animation shows the distances to known transiting exoplanet systems, in units of lightyears.

There are parts of France, I am told, where such questions are treated as a clear and present danger to the republic. In the name of secularism, some French judges have been known to rule that Muslim children be served pork chops from uncircumcised pigs that were slaughtered while facing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2014/jun/03/clone-wars-city-replicas-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Arc de Triomphe</a>.

My culinary repertoire is limited, and my go-to dish is bacon-infused macaroni cheese. As I went down my short list of alternatives – shepherd’s pie, salmon, chicken with lemon pearl barley, cauliflower cheese (the jury’s out on whether that constitutes a main course, but I’m not proud), it dawned on me that the real threat to social cohesion comes from vegans.</p> <p>I settled on plaice coated in breadcrumbs and parmesan – which should be served at Nobel prize ceremonies, since two weeks later I was also able to serve it to a kosher <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fishetarian\" title=\"\">fishetarian</a>. Satisfied with the menu, my guests had but one more question – should they bring red wine, white wine or beer for this halal meal?</p> <h2><strong>Ticket snub </strong></h2> <p>The University of Gloucestershire, it turns out, is primarily in Cheltenham. Had I known that when I bought my ticket to give a talk there recently I wouldn’t have booked myself on a train to Gloucester. My university host told me not to worry: “Gloucester’s only 10 minutes away and the train stops at Cheltenham first,” he said.</p> <p>This seemed reasonable. Since the train was stopping before the station I’d bought the ticket for, I figured there’d be no harm done. I’d be using less train – saving them money, really. Cheltenham’s ticket collector didn’t see it like that. I was in breach of “the terms and conditions [I] agreed to”, she said, making it sound like a subprime mortgage.</p> <p>“I know,” I said. “That was a mistake. I’m just not quite sure why that matters. Do you want me to go the extra 10 minutes out of spite?”</p> <p>She did. The barriers remained closed. “So what do I do now?” I asked. The train I had a ticket for had gone. I was ticketless in no man’s land. I wondered if I could claim asylum on platform two. Point made, power exercised, she had little further use for me. Contempt intervened where empathy could not: the barriers sprang open without a word.</p> <h2><strong>Chicago fry-up </strong></h2> <p>I’ve never really been one for brunch – breakfast or lunch: pick a side. But like the House of Lords and the US electoral college, I recognise it as a fact of life one has to navigate. That’s particularly true on Sundays in Chicago, when the challenge was to get there before the church crowd. They would emerge suited, booted, ravenous and en masse, blessing their pancakes and wiping out supplies of French toast before you could say Deuteronomy. If they beat you to it, “it” was gone.</p> <p>In Hackney, I’m told, the sweet spot is between the early risers (who work up an appetite doing Pilates or jogging into the sunrise) and the hangover people (who dance, drink or shag their way past dawn – maybe, if they are lucky, all three).</p> <p>Miss that slot and you have to queue with the virtuous or the hedonistic, while reflecting on how your life could and should be so different if only you’d got it together – a state of mind, I imagine, not too dissimilar to that of the church crowd I was so eager to avoid several thousand miles away.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10969980","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405510","internalRevision":"79","internalContentCode":"458370582","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"My friends’ request for halal food didn’t quite panic me but it did pose a challenge.

the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theicca.co.uk/\">Indian Community Centre Association in Nottingham</a>, according to its former chair Sudheer Gupta, “but there are lots of people going by their own transport as well. People are very excited. There are a lot of us who want to go and listen to what he has to say.”</p> <p>When Gupta and his colleagues set off on Friday they will be just one of many hundreds of delegations from around the UK <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ukwelcomesmodi.org/\">converging on Wembley stadium</a> to greet <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/narendra-modi\">Narendra Modi</a>, the prime minister of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/india\">India</a>, in the largest and arguably the most spectacular welcome any foreign leader has ever received in Britain.</p> <p>In total, 60,000 British Indians from <a href=\"https://www.ukwelcomesmodi.org/partners\">450 different community groups</a> – Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and others – are expected to pack into the national sports stadium to witness a rock star reception modelled on the Olympic opening ceremony, and almost matching it in ambition. Modi will be preceded at the free concert by an arts programme featuring 800 performers, including the Indian singing star Kanika Kapoor and the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and his address, coinciding with the festival of Diwali, will be followed by what is billed as one of the UK’s largest ever firework displays. </p> <p>Unlike the Chinese president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\">Xi Jinping</a>’s London visit in October, Modi’s trip to the UK is not a formal state visit, but the scale of the welcome being prepared for the 65-year-old is illustrative of his importance both to the huge Indian diaspora and to Britain as a whole. Modi will lunch with the Queen during his trip and is the first Indian prime minister ever to be invited to address both houses of parliament. During a packed three-day programme he will visit Indian businesses in the UK and stay a night at Chequers hosted by David Cameron. </p> <p>And though the Wembley concert is not an official event – it is being funded by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ukwelcomesmodi.org/#about-us\">Europe India Forum</a>, a non-profit company formed for the purpose by the multimillionaire British-Indian industrialist <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.lsbu.ac.uk/about-us/people-finder/prof-nathu-puri\">Nat Puri</a>, as well as corporate sponsors and thousands of individual donations – he will be introduced on stage by Cameron.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bc6219b3dbef482c44aa7e87072789ef8ea626b\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3bc6219b3dbef482c44aa7e87072789ef8ea626b/174_197_3993_2397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Narendra Modi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Modi was state governor when riots left 1,000 Muslims dead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It represents a remarkable turnaround for a man who, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/uk-ends-boycott-narendra-modi\">until three years ago</a>, had been banned for a decade from entering Britain, the US and several other European countries, following riots in Gujarat in 2002 in which 1,000 Muslims were killed by Hindu mobs. Modi, a Hindu nationalist who was state governor at the time, denied any involvement in the riots but was criticised for failing to do more to stop them. </p> <p>After Modi’s landslide election in 2014 as leader of the world’s biggest democracy (and now one of its fastest growing economies), the one-time pariah swiftly became a favoured partner, wooed by world leaders from Washington to Berlin to Beijing. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Cameron has been eager to secure a slice of India’s economic boom for Britain, and has said he would like the UK to become India’s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21495635\">“partner of choice”</a>. The employment minister, Priti Patel, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/pm-modis-visit-to-boost-special-relationship-of-india-uk-priti-patel/\">described Modi’s forthcoming visit</a> as a chance for the two countries to take their “special relationship into the modern context”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/intrel/people/index.php/cco2.html\">Chris Ogden</a>, senior lecturer in Asian security at the University of St Andrews and the author of a book on Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party, said: “The big difference between then and now is that Modi is prime minister, so when he meets leaders from other countries, they are less inclined to criticise him, particularly given the clout of India’s economic growth. India is rising, and a state such as Britain needs higher trade with India, so they are willing to downplay elements from his past.”</p> <p>The Leicester MP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/keithvaz\">Keith Vaz</a>, an enthusiastic cheerleader for the Modi visit, said it marked not only a “coming of age” for British Indians – “the community has organised the event, raised the money, booked the biggest venue in the country, without asking anyone’s permission” – but also an important shift in the power dynamic between the two countries.</p> <p>“It is now a relationship of equals, but more than that, you have Indian companies like Tata who are able to buy landmark British companies like <a href=\"http://www.jaguarlandrover.com/gl/en/about-us/our-history/\">Jaguar Land Rover</a> or <a href=\"http://www.tatasteeleurope.com/en/about-us/heritage\">Corus</a>, and are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/20/tata-steel-expected-to-announce-1200-job-losses-in-uk\">also able to close them</a>. That was unthinkable 30-40 years ago.

More than 40 MPs have <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/business-papers/commons/early-day-motions/edm-detail1/?session=2015-16&amp;edmnumber=257\">signed an early day motion</a> urging Cameron to ensure issues of human rights are discussed during Modi’s visit. In <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/india/report-india/\">its annual report</a> this year, Amnesty International criticised Modi’s government, saying there had been a rise in communal violence and repeated instances of human rights abuses by armed groups, while arrests and detentions of campaigners and journalists had persisted. </p> <p>The novelist Arundhati Roy became the latest literary figure to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/05/arundhati-roy-returns-award-protest-religious-intolerance-india-bollywood-modi-government-violence\">return an award</a> <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-i-am-returning-my-award/\">in protest</a> at growing religious violence in the country since the advent of the BJP government. And in a sign of deepening troubles back home, Modi’s party suffered a crushing defeat in state elections in the northern province of Bihar, a sign that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/08/narendra-modis-party-concedes-defeat-in-bihar-election\">its divisive sectarian rhetoric </a>is proving less effective. </p> <p>“Nobody doubts that there has to be a relationship between the Indian government and the British government, but I think that this stage-managed, high profile acceptance of Mr Modi just shows the hypocrisy of this government’s stance on human rights across the globe,” said Suresh Grover, of <a href=\"http://www.tmg-uk.org/\">The Monitoring Group</a>, one of a number of campaign groups planning a demonstration outside Downing Street when Modi arrives on Thursday. On Sunday <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/modi-uk-visit-british-indians-protest-indian-prime-minister-projection-onto-parliament-1527815\">campaigners projected a huge sign reading “Modi Not Welcome”</a> on to the side of the Houses of Parliament.</p> <p>Both Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, were among the signatories to the EDM, as well as the SNP’s Alex Salmond, the Green MP Caroline Lucas and Peter Bottomley, the sole Conservative on the list. Corbyn is expected to raise the issues in person with Modi during his visit. Vaz said he believed Corbyn’s support for the EDM was “unwise” and that human rights was not “an appropriate point on this visit”.</p> <p>But to Gupta and tens of thousands of ordinary British Indians, Modi’s ambition to turn India into a true global superpower, as symbolised in his immense welcome party, is a source of immense pride. “Because India is no longer a very poor country, although there are a lot of poor people there, there has been a change in how we are viewed over here. No Indian prime minister has struck gold with the people who live here like he has.”</p> <h2>Protests expected against Modi visit</h2> <p><em>Harriet Sherwood</em></p> <p>Several thousand people are expected to attend a demonstration against the visit of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to the UK this week. Critics say Modi’s government is cracking down on religious freedom and the campaigning work of NGOs and civil society organisations.</p> <p>An alliance of Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and representatives of the Dalit caste are among those backing the protest, which is being coordinated by the Awaaz network. The action has also gathered support from women’s groups, human rights groups, academics and students, anti-racist organisations and artists. The protest will begin at noon on Thursday outside Downing Street and move to Parliament Square.</p> <p>“There’s no doubt that Modi represents a political current that’s very rightwing, but this [protest] is really about an attack on the constitutional values of secular and religious freedom in India,” said Suresh Grover, of Awaaz.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p></p> <p>The group says Modi’s government “has created an authoritarian culture that is directly contrary to India’s democratic principles”. It cites attacks on minorities, including Muslims, Christians, LGBT groups, secularists, women, Dalit and numerous NGOs.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75aa8d43e94de1cad0f4c823bd7427c90259843a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/75aa8d43e94de1cad0f4c823bd7427c90259843a/0_119_5520_3314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest against the lynching in October of a Muslim farmer by Hindus upon hearing rumours that the family was eating beef.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest against the lynching in October of a Muslim farmer by Hindus upon hearing rumours that the family was eating beef.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among the NGOs that have faced restrictions on activity in India are Greenpeace and Amnesty International.

Harding said: “This is a small gesture of goodwill after a period of uncertainty.”</p> <p>The group was unspecific about the value of its offer, however. It says that it will be contacting customers between 1 December and 31 December with further details. It is also introducing a new bundle of online and telephone security measures to help protect customers from scammers, malware and cold callers.</p> <p>In a statement to its customers, TalkTalk said: “We would like to apologise for the unavoidable uncertainty over the last few months, whilst we have been working hard to understand the extent of the data accessed during our recent cyber attack.”</p> <p>Some customers have argued on social media that they should be allowed to get out of contracts free of charge given the scale of uncertainty caused by the attack and the way the group has dealt with it so publicly.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/06/nearly-157000-had-data-breached-in-talktalk-cyber-attack\">Nearly 157,000 had data breached in TalkTalk cyber-attack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There’s a helpline for all those who have been directly affected, and I would encourage anybody who is worried to call us,” Harding said. </p> <p>The group, which competes against the likes of BT, Sky and Virgin, has put the cost of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/talktalk-customer-data-hackers-website-credit-card-details-attack\">last month’s cyber-attack</a> at up to £35m but confounded market expectations by raising its dividend, sending its shares soaring by just over 10% on Thursday.<br /></p> <p>TalkTalk shares raced ahead to 245p before settling back to just under 240p at Thursday’s close, but they are still below the 290p level at which they were trading before the cyber-attack last month.</p> <p>Some analysts had feared that the dividend might be axed but instead it was raised by 15% to 5.29p, which Harding said underlined the group’s confidence in its future.</p> <p>Harding said that the one-off costs covered the upgrade to customers, increased enquiries to its call centres and additional IT and technology spending, as well as lost revenue from its online sales sites being down over the past three weeks. </p> <p>She added: “We of course saw an immediate spike in customers cancelling their direct debit, but actually after a few days we saw many of those customers reinstating their direct debits again, so time will tell, but the early signs are that customers think we are doing the right thing.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/08/talktalk-customer-reported-data-breach-as-early-as-2013\">TalkTalk customer reported data breach as early as 2013</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It emerged last week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/06/nearly-157000-had-data-breached-in-talktalk-cyber-attack\">almost 157,000 TalkTalk customers had their personal details hacked</a>, including 15,656 whose bank account numbers and sort codes were accessed. The total amounts to 4% of its 4 million customers.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>TalkTalk has faced growing criticism after it warned that the stolen customer data may not have been securely encrypted.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/23/talktalk-hacking-crisis-deepens-as-more-details-emerge\"> Harding said last month</a> she had personally been contacted by someone purporting to be the hacker, who made a ransom demand.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police has launched a criminal investigation into the attack, and the TalkTalk board has launched a review led by James Powell, an independent non-executive director.</p> <p>Harding said she had worked harder over the past three weeks than at any time over her career. “I think the most important decision was to warn all of our customers at the start. That was the right thing and I would take exactly the same decision again. It was the most open and honest thing to do,” said Harding, who has enjoyed the support of her chairman, Charles Dunstone, and the rest of the board so far.</p> <p>She explained that having access to the data alone was insufficient for criminals. “Theft required the customer being conned into giving more information,” she said.</p> <p>Not everyone agrees with that view, however. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown said on Wednesday: “The cyber attack on the company was handled badly, with hindsight. Few people were affected and little of any value was taken. Yet TalkTalk dominated the headlines for days on end.</p> <p>“Clearly, the company’s systems were tested and found wanting, and TalkTalk have a job to do rebuilding customers’ confidence in the integrity of their systems,” the broker said.</p> <p>Though it added that it is upbeat about the decision to reward customers with free upgrades. “Offering everyone, not just those whose data was accessed, a free upgrade is savvy; no one should mind the offer and those who take it up will presumably be re-contracting for another year or more,” the broker said. “So hopefully, for limited cash cost, TalkTalk will make their customer base more secure.”</p> <p>Revenues rose 4.7% to £912m in the six months to 30 September. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell to £90m from £110m.</p> <p>The cyber-attack was the second time in the past 12 months that TalkTalk customers have been affected by data breaches.<br /></p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971665","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405030","internalRevision":"1445","internalContentCode":"458366500","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"TalkTalk offers an upgrade to all of its customers after data breach, after putting cost of attack at £35m","allowUgc":"false","headline":"TalkTalk raises dividend as CEO reveals cyber-attack costs","byline":"Julia Kollewe and David Hellier","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T09:59:08Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c72558ddd5f99716604f2a48b1894af5b5e2e258/0_0_5000_3001/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5642f735e4b08b339848c396","newspaperPageNumber":"35","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-14T09:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>TalkTalk offers an upgrade to all of its customers after data breach, after putting cost of attack at £35m</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T08:07:17Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T22:01:18.316Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/talktalk-raises-dividend-cyber-attack-costs-revealed","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/nov/11/talktalk-raises-dividend-cyber-attack-costs-revealed","sectionName":"Business","elements":[{"id":"c72558ddd5f99716604f2a48b1894af5b5e2e258","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c72558ddd5f99716604f2a48b1894af5b5e2e258/0_0_5000_3001/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/c72558ddd5f99716604f2a48b1894af5b5e2e258","suppliersReference":"SWT09","altText":"Man walks past TalkTalk logo","caption":"TalkTalk had 4 million UK customers before the recent cyber-attack.

16-year-old Becky Watts was carefree and having fun. She attended a social evening at the local rugby club then stayed up all night with a friend playing computer games and watching films.</p> <p>Not long before she was attacked, she texted her boyfriend, Luke Oberhansli: “I love you so much.” Friends and relatives said she was looking forward to a bright, happy future. </p> <p>Life had not always been this good for Becky. Her parents, Darren Galsworthy and Tanya Watts, broke up and when she was three she began living with her father and his new partner, Anjie, the mother of Nathan Matthews. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Becky has left a huge void in our lives</p> <footer> <cite>Darren Galsworthy, Becky's father</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When she went to primary school she was so shy that she would not let Anjie leave her alone and her stepmother became an unpaid classroom helper so they could remain close.</p> <p>It got worse at secondary school when she was teased over her weight and she became anorexic aged 13. She dropped to less than 6st (38kg), refused to go to school and for a while was home tutored. </p> <p>Galsworthy described these as “very dark times”, adding: “Becky was bullied about her weight and we almost lost her to anorexia. But with a lot of care from us and hospital education we were able to get our Becky back.” </p> <p>Galsworthy said she gradually became more confident, began to go out more and more and became fashion conscious, always looking “immaculate”. Images shown to the jury of Becky’s bedroom revealed a love of shoes, trainers and boots (stacked neatly) and makeup. She liked music, was fond of animals and looked forward to trips to the cinema. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecce45edb0445fe70837be2b9b611c6b9c0391c0\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ecce45edb0445fe70837be2b9b611c6b9c0391c0/0_0_3152_1892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Becky Watts’s coffin carried by her father, Darren Galsworthy (front)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Becky Watts’s coffin carried by her father, Darren Galsworthy (front), into St Ambrose church in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her maternal grandmother, Patricia Watts, described Becky as a “faultless” girl, loyal, funny and sensible. Her mother, Tanya, said one of Becky’s talents was to keep her parents friendly after they split. She called her a “caring, normal, happy, lovely girl”. This is not to say she was perfect – like any teenager she had her moods and often clashed with her father and stepmother. </p> <p>Her murder, and what happened to her body afterwards, shocked Bristol, and hundreds of people turned out to her funeral, many in T-shirts featuring her image and throwing pink roses towards the horse-drawn carriage that bore her white coffin.</p> <p>Becky’s coffin was carried into the church to Leona Lewis’s song Footprints in the Sand, and Newton Faulkner’s Dream Catch Me was among the songs played during the service, which ended with Becky’s grandfather John Galsworthy singing the ballad Somewhere from the musical West Side Story. </p> <p>Darren Galsworthy summed up the mood: “Becky has left a huge void in our lives. We all loved you so much and as you look down from heaven just look at what your short life has achieved – not bad for a shy girl. You will forever be in our hearts and thoughts, rest in peace angel of Bristol.” </p>","internalOctopusCode":"10970646","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403590","internalRevision":"540","internalContentCode":"458354601","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"After overcoming severe shyness and anorexia, Becky had become a happy, fashion-loving teenager with a bright future when she was murdered","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Becky Watts: a shy girl who was growing in confidence","byline":"Steven Morris","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T14:26:13Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/42f29ff60cafa3080062c7ebdf7ac3ef3ecd4614/233_0_3327_1996/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56403560e4b0ace666f8bc7c","newspaperPageNumber":"6","standfirst":"<p>After overcoming severe shyness and anorexia, Becky had become a happy, fashion-loving teenager with a bright future when she was murdered</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-09T05:55:44Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T22:01:45.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/11/becky-watts-shy-girl-growing-confidence","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2015/nov/11/becky-watts-shy-girl-growing-confidence","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"42f29ff60cafa3080062c7ebdf7ac3ef3ecd4614","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/42f29ff60cafa3080062c7ebdf7ac3ef3ecd4614/233_0_3327_1996/140.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2015 Rex Features.

focus attention once more on the threat posed to women and children by the viewing of violent pornography and sexual abuse online.</p> <p>Matthews’s name can be added to the list of killers who apparently sought to act out perverted sexual fantasies on their victims, which were fed by the extreme pornography and abuse images they had watched on the internet. These include Mark Bridger, who killed April Jones, Stuart Hazell, the killer of schoolgirl Tia Sharp, Vincent Tabak who murdered Joanna Yeates, and Jamie Reynolds, who took the life of the teenager Georgia Williams. </p> <p>All these men – like Matthews – amassed and viewed horrific images of abuse and violent pornography, often closely linked to the horrific acts they later inflicted upon their victims. </p> <p>Hazell, for example, developed a sexual interest in 12-year-old Tia – the granddaughter of his girlfriend – and secretly filmed her. He had amassed images of child abuse and bestiality, often searching for pictures of girls who, like Tia, wore glasses. After Tia’s death, Hazell photographed her naked in a sexual position in an image he added to his collection. There was evidence that he had sexually abused her before she died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ae7daa04f581bcc040cc9e0aedf351495049d667\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ae7daa04f581bcc040cc9e0aedf351495049d667/0_0_1488_2233/666.jpg\" alt=\"Vincent Tabak.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vincent Tabak.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bridger, who abducted, sexually assaulted and killed five-year-old April Jones, kept explicit images of child sex abuse on his laptop. He had viewed a cartoon image of a bound girl being sexually abused by an adult just hours before April was abducted.</p> <p>Tabak strangled 25-year-old Joanna Yeates in a sexually motivated attack in December 2010. Detectives found violent images of sexual abuse on his laptop – including explicit videos of a blonde woman being throttled. He also amassed indecent images of children, often involving pre-pubescent girls being sexually assaulted by adult men. </p> <p>By the age of 22, Reynolds had collected 16,800 images and 72 videos of sexual violence. He wrote 40 stories about fatal attacks on girls and had drawn nooses on to copies of their Facebook photographs. He tricked 17-year-old Georgia, who was in his social circle, into coming to his house, pretending he was going to take artistic photographs of her. Reynolds had been watching extreme pornography immediately before Georgia arrived at his home, where he hanged her in May 2013. Photographs found on Reynolds’s hard drive show the last pictures of Georgia alive, smiling and posing with a red rope around her neck. The next series of photographs show her dead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are a lot of people that are exposed to these kind of images that do not engage in violent acts</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Jeffrey DeMarco, forensic psychologist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Giving evidence to MPs earlier this year, the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas, came close to directly linking the viewing of such images to sexual violence. The Reynolds case, he said, “left me in no doubt at all that the peddling of pornography on the internet had a dramatic effect on the individual ... it played a real part in the way in which this particular murder was carried out”.</p> <p>But there is no consensus in the published research on whether the viewing of violent pornography or child abuse images increases the likelihood of an individual carrying out contact abuse or even murder. </p> <p>Dr Elena Martellozzo, senior lecturer in criminology at Middlesex University, who works with the Metropolitan police and specialises in studying sex offenders, said while there were certainly links between the viewing of such images and the violence an individual might go on to perpetrate, not everyone who viewed such abuse images would go on to commit violent sexual acts themselves. </p> <p>“We have been working very closely with a number of sex offenders where once they have been arrested they were found in possession of a very large collection of indecent images of children,” she said. “But this is not to say that generally speaking, when people watch something particularly horrendous like this he or she may go on to commit an act of violence.”</p> <p> Her colleague Dr Jeffrey DeMarco, forensic psychologist at Middlesex University, added: “We do talk about it as being a potential risk factor. So viewing violent digital literature, photographs, videos, images arguably – if these actions are in the narrative of this particular individual – would mean there’s an increased probability that their behaviour may go on to be of a violent nature. But there are a lot of people that are exposed to these kind of images that do not engage in violent acts.”</p> <p>What is unequivocal, however, is the dramatic proliferation of online images of abuse and violent sexual acts over the last few years, and the huge increase in individuals who are accessing it. According to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (Ceop) unit, the number of unique child abuse images in circulation on the internet now runs into millions.</p> <p>In 2012, Ceop received 8,000 reports of indecent images of children being shared, featuring 70,000 still images and videos. It estimated there were about 50,000-60,000 individuals in the UK involved in downloading and sharing indecent images of children. A nationwide investigation into internet paedophiles that began in 2014 identified digital traces of more than 25,000 people suspected of viewing images of child abuse in the UK. It led to 660 arrests, but the National Crime Agency said it would never be able to pursue all those caught up in the inquiry.</p> <p>The case of Matthews is as bleak and horrifying as all those which have gone before. As he faces a lifetime in jail, what is clear to investigators is that while online abuse images continue to proliferate at such a rate, the threat to children and young women remains significant.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10970655","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403839","internalRevision":"556","internalContentCode":"458356726","publication":"The

up to 100 in the UK, where it plans to cut lager production after Tesco said it would stop stocking its beers.</p> <p>The Danish firm said it would cut production at its Northampton plant after its strategy of using price promotions to deliver higher supermarket sales fell flat. </p> <p>The world’s fourth-largest beer producer announced the overhaul on Wednesday alongside a £438m loss in the third quarter, largely caused by problems with its Russian business.</p> <p>Approximately 2,000 white collar jobs will be cut – 4% of its global workforce of 46,800 – as part of a recovery plan Carlsberg calls Funding the Journey.</p> <p>The plan is expected to threaten nearly 100 jobs at its Northampton brewery, Leeds office and 12 regional distribution depots. </p> <p>Union sources said the move was particularly difficult for staff after the company imposed <a href=\"http://www.spaldingtoday.co.uk/news/latest-news/almost-200-carlsberg-workers-in-northampton-to-take-industrial-action-1-6980818\">a global pay freeze in 2014</a>.</p> <p>The brewer, whose adverts proclaim it to be “probably the best beer in the world” has 13% of the UK market through brands such as Carlsberg, Tuborg, Tetley’s and Somersby Cider.</p> <p>Carlsberg has previously tried to bolster sales by selling its products at bargain prices in supermarkets such as Tesco. But <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/tesco-pulls-carlsberg-products-from-supermarket-shelves-a3072391.html\">the retailer’s decision to stop stocking Carlsberg </a>has rendered that strategy obsolete.</p> <p>It has also been hit by overcapacity among major brewers, with mass-market brands coming under pressure from more premium “craft” beers. Carlsberg acknowledged the so-called craft beer revolution this year by expanding its Crafted range of quality ales, lagers and stouts that it sells to pubs. </p> <p>These include third-party brands such as the Californian ale Lagunitas IPA, as well as some from its own stable such as the Backyard Brewery, part of its Falkenberg operation in Sweden.</p> <p>It plans to cut production volumes and focus on improving its image, which has suffered despite sponsoring the Premier League and England football team. </p> <p>Analyst Trevor Stirling, at Bernstein, said: ‘‘In order to stay in Tesco they were putting money into price promotions instead of investing. They need to put more money behind the brand.”</p> <p>Carlsberg UK’s difficulties led it to it ask suppliers to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/10/carlsberg-joins-hall-of-shame-for-delaying-supplier-payments\">wait an extra three months for payment</a>, a request branded “grossly unfair” this week by the Forum of Private Business. The company said on Tuesday it was starting a “formal review of its customer supply chain operations”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/10/carlsberg-joins-hall-of-shame-for-delaying-supplier-payments\">Carlsberg  joins 'Hall of Shame' for delaying supplier payments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Michiel Herkemij has been appointed interim chief executive to oversee the planned job cuts and strategic shift. “Unfortunately the proposed restructuring process may result in redundancies in some areas of the business and we will support the impacted employees through the consultation period,” he said. </p> <p>Union officials are due to meet with Carlsberg management next week to discuss the proposed cuts.</p> <p>Carlsberg’s third quarter loss was largely caused by a £732m cut in the value of its Russian and Chinese businesses, part of £948m in anticipated impairments by 2017.</p> <p>Drinkers in Russia have been switching to cheaper brands amid dismal economic conditions and a tumbling rouble, which has made foreign imports even more expensive. A turnaround plan in China also failed to bear fruit amid the twin challenges of a declining market and more intense competition.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971500","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405513","internalRevision":"525","internalContentCode":"458370600","publication":"The

thanks to jaws that can grind five times stronger than a human, or with 50 times more force than its body weight, researchers said.</p> <p>Faced with tough materials such as wood, they activate muscle fibres in their jaw to boost their bite to cope with repetitive, heavy-duty tasks, a study in the journal Plos One said on Wednesday.</p> <p>“Ours is the first study to measure the bite forces of ordinary insects, and we found that the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, can generate a bite force around 50 times stronger than its own body weight,” said lead author Tom Weihmann from the University of Cambridge’szoology department.</p> <p>“In relative terms that’s about five times stronger than the force a human can generate with their jaws.”</p> <p>Researchers wanted to understand the cockroach’s bite because insects play a crucial role in many ecosystems and findings could enable “bioinspired engineering”, said Weihmann.</p> <p>The team analysed 300 bites made by specimen cockroaches, ranging from quick and feeble bites to powerful, long-lasting ones. “The weaker, shorter bites were generated by relatively fast muscle fibres, while the longer, stronger bites were driven by additional muscle fibres that take time to reach their maximum force,” said Weihmann.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405676","internalRevision":"380","internalContentCode":"458371877","publication":"The

The instituteproduced the report on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.hospiceuk.org/\">Hospice UK</a> and <a href=\"http://www.togetherforshortlives.org.uk/\">Together for Short Lives</a>, a charity for children with life-limiting conditions.</p> <p>Unless existing hospices take positive steps to be inclusive, Muslims are likely to set up parallel institutions with implications for social cohesion and integration, said Ahmed.<br /></p> <p>Underlying changes in the British Muslim community are highlighted by the report, Bridging the Gap, published on Thursday. “All demographic indications point to Britain’s older Muslim citizens becoming in need of hospice and broader end of life care services in increasing numbers over the coming years ... The increase of elderly people coupled with a gradual shift towards more nuclear and smaller family groups will mean the number of users requiring palliative care services will increase significantly over the period of a generation,” it says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/11/muslim-population-england-wales-nearly-doubles-10-years\">Muslim population in England and Wales nearly doubles in 10 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the 2011 census, there were <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rpt-religion.html\">2.7 million Muslims living in the UK, or almost 4.8% of the population</a>, making them the largest religious group after Christians. Although the Muslim community is generally young, with 33% aged 15 or under, 4% were over 65 – with numbers increasing as those who came to the UK as young men and women in the 1960s and 1970s grow older.<br /></p> <p>Meanwhile, Muslim family patterns are changing with successive generations. In contrast to traditional extended families, the pressures of finding work, good schools and affordable homes are driving younger Muslims increasingly to live apart from their parents and older relatives. Rising numbers of Muslim women are working outside the home. These factors, said Ahmed, challenge “cultural norms and values for Muslims to look after the elderly and sick”.<br /></p> <p>One person told the report’s authors: “You know we are raised to believe that we will take care of our parents, it is our duty and we are happy to do that. But not all are able to do that. So make people aware that you can still have loved ones in a hospice and it’s OK. And this is one of the biggest challenges that [hospice staff] have in getting over the taboo that Muslims have … about not caring for your parent. You know I quit my job to care for my mum, I was lucky to be able to do that, I realise not all people can afford that.

However, UK citizens are not required to state religion or ethnicity on death certificates which, the report says, “give[s] rise to real challenges in the exploration of social patterns in deaths and, accordingly, of patterns of end of life care.”<br /></p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971306","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405153","internalRevision":"441","internalContentCode":"458367485","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Report says rising numbers of elderly Muslims mean hospices must overcome barriers that have traditionally seen such patients shun their services","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Hospices 'must take more inclusive approach to ageing Muslims'","byline":"Harriet Sherwood Religion correspondent","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-12T00:01:02Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/02f6513268dc37434db26fb0aa98975aa1cea401/0_73_4000_2399/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"564323f2e4b00d947b614ef5","newspaperPageNumber":"18","standfirst":"<p>Report says rising numbers of elderly Muslims mean hospices must overcome barriers that have traditionally seen such patients shun their services</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T11:18:10Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T00:01:04.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/12/hospices-must-take-more-inclusive-approach-ageing-muslims","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2015/nov/12/hospices-must-take-more-inclusive-approach-ageing-muslims","sectionName":"Society","elements":[{"id":"02f6513268dc37434db26fb0aa98975aa1cea401","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/02f6513268dc37434db26fb0aa98975aa1cea401/0_73_4000_2399/140.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"2015 Getty Images","picdarUrn":"GD*53975153","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/02f6513268dc37434db26fb0aa98975aa1cea401","suppliersReference":"560489713","altText":"Men queuing to enter the main prayer hall of East London mosque","caption":"Men queuing to enter the main prayer hall of East London mosque.

(Rics), published on Thursday, showed the supply drought continued into the autumn, and that prices have taken off in East Anglia. </p> <p>Rics’s report showed that, across the UK, 10% more members

Looking ahead over the next three months, 5% more of those questioned in the capital said they expected prices to rise than to fall. </p> <p>Figures from mortgage lenders show there has been an increase in lending since the spring, while HM Revenue &amp; Customs has reported an increase in transactions. Rics said members in every region except London and the east Midlands had seen a pick-up in the number of sales agreed in October.</p> <p>Rics’s chief economist, Simon Rubinsohn, said: “It is hard to get away from the issue of supply when it comes to the current state of the housing market. </p> <p>“The legacy of the drop in new build, following the onset of the global financial crisis, is now really hitting home, with both the sales and letting markets continuing to show demand outstripping supply on a month-by-month basis.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/09/economics-housing-britain-political-policy-communities\">The economics of scale: how housing became Britain’s biggest political issue | Andy Beckett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rics members said they expected prices to rise by just less than 4.5% a year for the next five years, an increase that would add £42,000 to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/28/average-london-home-500000-in-north-east-england-100000\">average cost of a home</a> in England and Wales. The cost of renting is expected to rise at a similar rate over the same period, as demand from tenants stays strong. Around the UK, demand for rented homes continues to outstrip supply, said Rics. </p> <p>“If the five-year projections from members regarding the outlook for both prices and rents is anything to go by, property is set to become even more unaffordable going forward, making the government’s focus on boosting the delivery of new homes absolutely critical,” said Rubinsohn. <br /></p> <p>Alan Williams, from the Colchester branch of estate agency Fenn Wright, said there was still a lot of demand in the market. “Any fall-throughs we have are reselling quickly, and often at higher figures,” he added.</p> <p>Another agent in East Anglia, Chris Philpot, of Lacy Scott and Knight in Stowmarket, said: “The market has now tailed off after a hectic summer, but strong prices are still being achieved. Instead of vendors dropping prices to sell during the last months of 2015, buyers are paying good prices to make a purchase before the winter.”

On a three-monthly basis, regular wages, excluding bonuses, grew at an annual rate of 2.5% in the three months to September, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/14/unemployment-wage-rises-figures-ons-george-osborne\">down from 2.8% in the three months to August</a>. Including bonuses, wage growth was unchanged, at 3%.</p> <p>Looking at the more volatile monthly data, the deterioration was more marked, with regular pay growth slipping to just 1.9%, the weakest since January.</p> <p>With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/13/uk-inflations-dips-below-zero\">inflation at -0.1%</a>, driven by the continuing weakness in commodity prices, real wages are rising at a healthy rate; but take-home pay remains well below pre-crisis levels, and the slowdown raised concerns about what would happen once inflation starts to pick up again.</p> <p>Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, described the data as “especially worrying, given that the government is about to announce severe cuts, which will reduce demand across the economy, making pay growth harder to maintain”.</p> <p>Over the past year, almost three quarters of the jobs created have gone to non-UK nationals, predominantly from inside the EU, according to the Office for National Statistics, a fact that is likely to sharpen the debate about free movement as David Cameron seeks to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Brussels. </p> <p>The number of UK nationals in jobs jumped by 122,000 in a year, to 28.09 million, the ONS said; while the number of non-UK nationals working in the UK increased by 326,000, to 3.22 million.</p> <p>The Bank of England’s <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/agentssummary/2015/nov.pdf\">monthly report</a> from its local agents up and down the country, also published on Wednesday, offered separate evidence of weakness, saying that while pay pressure was building in some sectors, “hiring intentions had eased, alongside slower demand growth and an increasing focus on raising productivity”.</p> <p>Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said improvements in productivity would be the key to generating wage rises in the coming months. “The good news is that signs of a return to productivity growth should generate more upward pay pressure. That will be particularly important once inflation starts to rise.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/10/ten-things-you-should-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap\">Ten facts you might not know about the gender pay gap | Laura Bates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rapid improvement in the labour market has been one of the strongest features of Britain’s economic recovery in recent years. Nick Palmer, of the ONS, said: “These figures continue the recent strengthening trend in the labour market, with a new record high in the employment rate and the unemployment rate still at its lowest since spring 2008.”</p> <p>George Osborne, keen to cement his reputation for economic management amid the tax credits controversy, said the figures were “excellent news”. The chancellor added: “At 73.7% our employment rate has never been higher and we are moving towards the goal of full employment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/31/george-osborne-full-employment-britain-inflation\">that I set out a year ago</a>.”</p> <p></p> <p><br /></p> <p>However the weakening of pay growth is likely to undermine the argument of anti-inflation hawks on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/05/interest-rate-bank-of-england-leave-record-low-decision\">Bank of England’s monetary policy committee</a>, who have argued that interest rates should rise to prevent wage growth running out of control. </p> <p>John Philpott, of the Jobs Economist consultancy firm, said: “While we can continue to take comfort in the general health of the UK employment situation there is nothing in these latest data to support the kind of ‘overheating labour market’ narrative that might be used to suggest the Bank of England should start to raise interest rates sooner rather than later.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971442","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405069","internalRevision":"1250","internalContentCode":"458366811","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Employment rate hit record high of 73.7% but weakened earnings growth could threaten living standards if inflation starts to rise, data shows","allowUgc":"false","headline":"British pay growth slows but labour market remains robust","byline":"Heather Stewart","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T11:24:26Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/9f425ef8a8315a5ebf27ebe0ae491e46783cfdee/0_193_5708_3425/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56430cbbe4b0ddf11c1fbf5a","newspaperPageNumber":"21","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-14T11:30:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Employment rate hit record high of 73.7% but weakened earnings growth could threaten living standards if inflation starts to rise, data shows</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T09:39:07Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T00:30:04.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/british-pay-growth-slows-while-labour-market-remains-healthy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/nov/11/british-pay-growth-slows-while-labour-market-remains-healthy","sectionName":"Business","elements":[{"id":"9f425ef8a8315a5ebf27ebe0ae491e46783cfdee","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/9f425ef8a8315a5ebf27ebe0ae491e46783cfdee/0_193_5708_3425/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Edward Moss / Alamy","picdarUrn":"GD*51449718","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/9f425ef8a8315a5ebf27ebe0ae491e46783cfdee","suppliersReference":"E0FC26","altText":"Welder in factory","caption":"A welder works on machinery in a British factory.

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marina-abramovic\">Marina Abramović</a>, the world’s best-known performance artist, is being sued by her former collaborator and romantic partner, the German artist known as Ulay, in a dispute over works they created jointly.</p> <p>Belgrade-born Abramović and Ulay, real name Frank Uwe Laysiepen, were lovers and co-creators for more than a decade before their separation in 1988, during which time they devised a series of works exploring their partnership. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related:

relationship came to prominence in 2010, during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/mar/19/art-marina-abramovic-moma\">an installation at MoMA in New York</a> in which Abramović sat in a chair in a gallery for eight hours a day and invited strangers to sit opposite her and look into her eyes. When Ulay unexpectedly took a seat, she began to cry and reached across to hold his hands; the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlf68X2qEpM\">video of the encounter</a> has been viewed by millions on YouTube. <br /></p> <p>The memory of that tender moment has now been banished, however, after Ulay launched a lawsuit, to be heard in Amsterdam later this month, in which he claims Abramović has violated a contract they signed in 1999 covering works they had created together. </p> <p>Ulay claims that Abramović has asked galleries to list her as the sole author of their joint works, contrary to the terms of the contract, has failed to provide him with accurate statements of sales, and has paid him only four times in the course of 16 years. </p> <p>“She is not just a former business partner,” he told the Guardian. “The whole oeuvre has made history. It’s now in school books. But she has deliberately misinterpreted things, or left my name out.”</p> <p>But Abramovic’s lawyer said the artist “totally disagrees” with her former partner’s allegations. “My client doesn’t want to comment on them, they are libellous. My client considers that this lawsuit is abusive and aimed to damage her reputation in public, which is proven by his allegations to you. My client is very confident in her position in front of the court. She will defend her rights and reputation by all legal means.”</p> <p>When the couple separated in 1988, they decided to mark the end of their relationship with a piece called <a href=\"http://www.li-ma.nl/site/catalogue/art/abramovic-ulay/the-lovers-the-great-wall-walk/8754\">The Lovers</a>, in which they each walked 2,500km from either end of the Great Wall of China, before embracing and parting for the last time.</p> <p>Ulay says he later sold his physical archive to Abramović, who agreed to maintain it and supervise the production of saleable materials from it, in the form of videos, photographs and performances. All profits were to be divided as follows: 50% to the gallery, 30% to Abramović and 20% to Ulay.</p> <p>But his lawsuit claims that she has interpreted the contract to give him a much smaller share of royalties. In addition, Ulay alleges that Abramović prevented him from including images of their joint works in his 2014 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Whispers-Ulay-Maria-Rus-Bojan/dp/9078088729\">Whispers: Ulay on Ulay</a> – resulting in multiple redactions that were replaced in its pages with pale pink squares – and objected to the establishment of the Ulay Foundation, an organisation intended to manage his posthumous estate.</p> <p>The case will be heard at Amsterdam district court later this month.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971649","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405439","internalRevision":"323","internalContentCode":"458369925","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"A lawsuit has been launched against the world’s best-known performance artist, which claims she is in violation of a contract over their joint works.

Ploughs and harrows had left their marks, a crisscross patchwork of parallel lines. Some fields had lightly furrowed brows, others deep gullies and humpbacked hills.</p> <p>Pigeons flew overhead, flapping across from north to south, south to north, east to west and back, as if resetting their bearings.</p> <p>In their short lives skylarks had seen it all before, the frequent transformations of their landscapes. A pair took off from the newly tilled bare earth, chasing in tandem, making mazy, quicksilver, patterns with their white tail feathers glinting against the soil, as if they were playing with sparklers.</p> <p>One would throw out a loop and the other would hold to its slipstream. It lasted for only a few seconds until the birds dropped out of sight, the light going out as quickly as it had ignited. Here was a vignette of grace and agility, a party trick to add to the birds’ more famous song flight.</p> <p>An ornithologist named RB Martin first recorded the chase when, during the second world war, he spent a year following a single skylark in the fields of Middlesex. Such frenetic pursuits may be linked to courtship. Or they may not.</p> <p>It was mid afternoon and it became clear that we were on a starling highway. A flock came down to land a few fields off. Though the starlings looked like a dark swarm of bees, they had two inky blobs in their midst, for they had acquired a pair of crow interlopers.</p> <p>Staying low, they were rolling like tank tracks, the birds at the back lifting, flying to the front and drawing the whole flock forwards. Silent in flight, they came to ground with a great susurration.</p> <p>They rose again and made a body, swerving as one. The crows parted from their flexible host, lacking the telepathy or ability to keep up.</p> <p>Another starling flock appeared from the same direction, half spilling on the ground, half lining up on telegraph wires. And then another, pouring out of nowhere, flying to who knows where.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10970289","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405496","internalRevision":"124","internalContentCode":"458370406","publication":"The

If sporting stars cheat they are banned. If sporting countries cheat they should be banned. But when everyone cheats, what to do? The answer is to panic, lie and then cover your tracks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/nov/10/sebastian-coe-problems-reform-iaaf\">Why some are doubting Sebastian Coe’s clean-up credentials at the IAAF | Owen Gibson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If there’s one thing the Russians know about international sport, it is where others have hidden their skeletons. Shut out the Russians and the whole murky edifice might come crashing down. Britain’s Lord Coe, new president of the IAAF, based in that well-known athletics centre, Monaco, said he knew nothing about the doping saga. Indeed, he claimed it was all got up by the press, until the press and the IAAF’s own investigator, Dick Pound, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/09/london-olympics-russia-doping-report\" title=\"\">showed otherwise</a>.</p> <p>Coe has spent eight years as IAAF vice-president under a man he calls his “spiritual” master, Lamine Diack, who’s now being investigated by the police for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/04/lamine-diack-investigation-iaaf-corruption-doping\" title=\"\">massive corruption</a>. And Coe knew nothing about it? If he didn’t know, then he ought to have. As a well-paid consultant to Nike and practised hotel lobby schmoozer, can he be the man to cleanse these Augean stables?</p> <p>The Olympics, cycling, ice-skating, baseball, football and athletics have all been afflicted by doping and/or financial scandals over the years. Most trouble has emanated from international bodies supposedly overseeing and policing these sports. In a clear conflict of interest, they also stage and derive income from the festivals of chauvinism that now pass for world sports competitions. Hence the outrageous cost of Athens, Beijing, London, South Africa and now Rio.</p> <p>These extravaganzas are promoted by a cosmopolitan elite of bureaucrats, whipping up hysteria over who will “win” the right to be host. In 2005, Britain had to pay a £500,000 “fee” to the International Olympic Committee just to be allowed to bid (it forgot to add the bribes). Non-government bids are now banned, for fear of parsimony. The only modern Olympiad not to make money (for the IOC) was when no government stepped forward and the games went private, in Los Angeles 1984.</p> <p>Thus politicised, sports are de facto nationalised, and funded to win. Woe betide failure. British swimmers were <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/other-sports/swimming-funding-is-cut-after-dismal-olympic-showing-8424247.html\" title=\"\">penalised financially</a> by David Cameron for poor performance in 2012, a gesture redolent of a crude dictatorship. Small wonder the pressure to cheat is overwhelming, and the cheating, as in Russia and other as yet unnamed states, can also be “nationalised”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/09/drug-riddled-athletics-lord-coe\">The road to redemption for drug-scarred athletics looks like an ultramarathon | Jeanette Kwakye</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Any journalist acquainted with professional sport over the past half century has known about drugs. We were told the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/that-1980s-sports-blog/2013/oct/21/ben-johnson-carl-lewis-dirtiest-race-history\" title=\"\">Ben Johnson scandal</a> at the 1988 Olympics would put a stop to doping. Nothing put a stop to it. The money and prestige is too great. In the case of soccer’s Fifa, it was clear for decades that Sepp Blatter’s operation was rotten to the core. A lone British journalist, Andrew Jennings, struggled to expose the IOC and Fifa’s Blatter, to the silence or ridicule of British representatives on both bodies.</p> <p>Europe’s sporting quangos, police and most of its media turned a blind eye to these goings-on. Sport is the holy mother church of the age. Only when the BBC and Sunday Times produced incontrovertible evidence of wrong-doing at Fifa did England’s Football Association start whingeing.</p> <p>But football’s bosses would not do the honourable thing and withdraw. There was too much money, perks and national glory at stake. No one lifted a finger until an American public attorney this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/17/michael-garcia-resigns-fifa-ethics-committee\" title=\"\">blew the whistle</a> on Europe’s favourite sport.</p> <p>The IOC, now in the pocket of a few big contractors and television networks, is solely concerned with raising the costs and revenue of each successive Olympics. Anyone who doubts this should read Andrew Zimbalist’s book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/22/circus-maximus-andrew-zimbalist-review\" title=\"\">Circus Maximus</a>. It tells how a tiny, unaccountable cartel impoverished one world city after another, enthusiastically supported by grovelling national politicians – with Britain in the lead.</p> <p>Back in the 1990s as the stink began to rise over this swamp, Britain should have had led a walkout. Instead its representatives, laden with royal patronage, were pampered, conned and invited not to look too closely at the books. They got luxury trips and free tickets. Yet they were supposedly running world sports. They must have read the cuttings. They cannot plead ignorance. If the humblest journalist knew, they knew.</p> <p>The root issue is our old friend, accountability. International sport is a potent cocktail of money, fame and no one in charge. Were this run as show business, which is what it really is, nothing would matter. In show business the government is not involved and risk is taken by private individuals. In today’s international sport, governments are all over it. Taxpayers don’t just take the risk, they pay.</p> <p>There has to be a new framework of governance, properly beholden to some elected or openly representative body. Self-selection, self-policing, self-auditing and self-perpetuation are the short route to corruption. But such reform will never take place as long as nation states kowtow and never resign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/nov/08/sebastian-coe-iaaf-doping-investigation\">Sebastian Coe must now launch assault on doping to retain credibility</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year the people of Brazil, saddled by their rulers with both the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/apr/23/world-cup-olympics-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-sensation-disaster\" title=\"\">World Cup and the Olympics</a>, took to the streets in violent protest. This had not the slightest effect on Fifa and the IOC. Their inspectors flicked the dust from their Guccis and told the Brazilians to spend even more – and get the peasants to shut up.</p> <p>Britain is master appeaser of this nonsense. It inflated its 2012 Olympics budget from £3bn to £9bn – imposing this baseline cost of a fortnight’s sport on the poor of Rio. It claimed this would be fine as Britain “made £13bn” from the event. In reality that was the probable loss. England then bid to host the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/28/england-2018-world-cup-russia-lennart-johansson\" title=\"\">2018 World Cup</a>, when it had already been given to Russia. Vladimir Putin did not even show up at the declaration. So much for English intelligence.</p> <p>Britain will endure any humiliation to strut any “world stage” going. Its politicians want to be seen to win, and bask in reflected glory. The empire dies hard. Sport ranks with nuclear weapons and opera houses as a vital national interest – in prestige. There nothing wrong with boosting the nation’s pride, were it not floated on a mire of venality and corruption.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10969976","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405586","internalRevision":"57","internalContentCode":"458371234","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The doping allegations rocking athletics seem inevitable given how nations bow before those running sport","allowUgc":"false","headline":"It’s not just Russia: Britain helped create this corruption in sport","byline":"Simon Jenkins","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-12T07:00:03Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/7c23fc212c14609f4084fe928ba9be0c008e0414/0_0_4444_2668/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56438b39e4b0560d979936d3","newspaperPageNumber":"43","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-15T07:00:03Z","standfirst":"The doping allegations rocking athletics seem inevitable given how nations bow before those running sport","creationDate":"2015-11-11T18:38:49Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T07:00:08.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/12/not-just-russia-britain-corruption-allegations-athletics-sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/12/not-just-russia-britain-corruption-allegations-athletics-sport","sectionName":"Comment is free","elements":[{"id":"7c23fc212c14609f4084fe928ba9be0c008e0414","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/7c23fc212c14609f4084fe928ba9be0c008e0414/0_0_4444_2668/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/7c23fc212c14609f4084fe928ba9be0c008e0414","suppliersReference":"DV2176781","altText":"Sebastien Coe, pictured with the then IAAF president, Lamine Diack, at the London 2012 Olympic Games.

Seeing the combination of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/aids-and-hiv\" title=\"\">“HIV”</a> and “panic” in print is not something my generation is accustomed to; three decades ago, it was a tragic norm. For those who have spent much of their lives campaigning to overcome the stigma of this treatable illness, it is a bleak day. “Even with the advances made in HIV testing and treatment, this shows that unfounded prejudices still remain,” says the Terrence Higgins Trust. “It is attitudes like these that perpetuate HIV stigma.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/04/hiv-positive-leak-patients-stigma\">Life with HIV has changed enormously. It’s time public perception followed suit | Tom Hayes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If a celebrity – or anybody else – has HIV, it really is none of our business. And portraying them as a walking biological weapon – carriers of a pestilence that makes them a threat to others – has terrible consequences. On the one hand such tabloid witch-hunting helps to make people living with HIV feel isolated, increasing depression and anxiety. But it also means fewer people choose to be tested.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/STIs/Pages/HIV.aspx\" title=\"\">Around one in four people with HIV don’t know that they have it</a>, and this helps the virus to spread. Indeed, HIV numbers continue to rise: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hiv-infections-continue-to-rise\" title=\"\">approaching 110,000 Britons live with the illness</a>; in 2013, 6,000 were newly diagnosed. Given four of 10 people who are diagnosed have late-stage HIV, the need to encourage testing to ensure early detection and early treatment speaks for itself: the likes of the Sun will only undermine these efforts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The HIV epidemic became a means of reinforcing existing prejudices and discrimination towards gay men</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Obviously there should be no complacency when it comes to halting HIV’s spread. But what makes the Sun’s story so out of sync with reality is that HIV is no longer a death sentence in this country. Patients properly treated can expect to live normal lives with normal life expectancies. Current treatments are so effective, says the Terrence Higgins Trust, that they reduce HIV to an undetectable level, meaning that those living with the illness cannot pass it on.</p> <p>This is a good time for HIV treatment and prevention. When taken daily by those without the illness, tests show that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/09/04/in-new-study-hiv-prevention-pill-truvada-is-startlingly-100-percent-effective/\" title=\"\">may be entirely effective at stopping people becoming infected</a>. The NHS is still refusing to prescribe the drug to high-risk individuals – though it is far cheaper than <a href=\"http://new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/why-wont-our-condom-obsessed-nhs-back-this-wonder-drug/\" title=\"\">treating people after infection</a> – although campaigners are doing their best to force the medical authorities to see sense. And <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/positive-results-for-gsk-and-johnson-and-johnson-trial-2015-11?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">new treatments may be on the way</a>, such as an injection every one to two months, instead of a cumbersome daily regimen of pills.</p> <p>And yet the stigma remains. It would be easy to dismiss it as confined to rightwing redtops, but that isn’t true either. You might expect support and solidarity among gay men; after all, HIV was a trauma that, in the west, hit gay men disproportionately in the 1980s, and the collective memory of the calamity endures among the younger generation. Many older gay men watched their partners and friends die horrible deaths; and the HIV epidemic became a means of reinforcing existing prejudices and discrimination towards gay men as a whole.</p> <p>But HIV stigma is rampant among gay men. Those who are open about their status risk being shunned; Terrence Higgins Trust staff even know of stories of HIV-positive gay men on dating apps being berated for being there in the first place. There is a tragic tradition of oppressed groups imbibing the prejudices and behaviour of their oppressors. For much of our history, gay men have been treated as lepers; at best, as objects of pity; and commonly as objects of disgust. People felt uncomfortable around them, threatened by their very presence. And this, today, is how all too many gay men treat people with HIV.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/sep/02/undiagnosed-hiv-bme-stigma\">Rachel is composed, confident  – and unable to tell anyone she is HIV-positive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is, perhaps, an unsurprising symptom of a pandemic that particularly affects gay men: internalised homophobia. Even after the great advances made in the decades-long quest for LGBT emancipation, gay men are all too often made to feel wrong, as somehow dirty. However subconsciously, the HIV epidemic – and the way it was stigmatised as the “gay plague” – has reinforced such feelings. I know of many gay men who, not long after a sexual encounter, start worrying if a sudden sneezing fit is evidence of being infected with HIV.</p> <p>Although the battle against homophobia is far from over, many gay men feel they have won an acceptance, even respectability, that earlier generations could only have dreamed of. But because it is so recent, it feels precarious: HIV is a reminder of an era that is so near to our own. We have progressed to a respectability that could suddenly could be lost, reviving again the stigma that earlier generations had to contend with.</p> <p>To see HIV stigma flaunt itself in the mainstream – after so much effort, and so many years dedicated to overcoming it – is depressing indeed. Still, it does focus the mind again as to the continued existence of this deadly phenomenon. Elton John is right that HIV will only be overcome <a href=\"https://www.enca.com/%E2%80%98stigma%E2%80%99-hiv%E2%80%99s-most-deadly-symptom\" title=\"\">“by eradicating its most deadly symptom: stigma”</a>.</p> <p>There are people reading this who have put off an HIV test because they fear their life will be ruined: not by the illness itself but by the associations that cling to it. Newspapers read by millions will make that worse. But so will the stigma that marries itself to the internalised shame of so many gay men. Both need a reckoning.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10970396","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405549","internalRevision":"93","internalContentCode":"458370975","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"As medical advances help thousands of people, it would be disastrous to revert to bigoted attitudes in public and the media","allowUgc":"false","headline":"We can’t go back to the deadly HIV stigma of the 1980s","byline":"Owen Jones","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T19:30:56Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/59d1e4a277c29a422387f84a66a5188108048079/0_159_4256_2554/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56437e40e4b05f01ec0a2d98","newspaperPageNumber":"42","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-14T19:30:00Z","standfirst":"<p>As medical advances help thousands of people, it would be disastrous to revert to bigoted attitudes in public and the media</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T17:43:28Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T08:27:18.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/11/hiv-stigma-1980s","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/11/hiv-stigma-1980s","sectionName":"Comment is free","elements":[{"id":"59d1e4a277c29a422387f84a66a5188108048079","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/59d1e4a277c29a422387f84a66a5188108048079/0_159_4256_2554/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2015 Rex Features.

It concluded that Dyson’s action for “annulment of the regulation on energy labelling of vacuum cleaners” had been unsuccessful.</p> <p>Dyson Ltd branded the decision “deplorable” and said that the ECJ had failed to act in the interests of consumers. </p> <p>The company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/21/anger-as-eu-bans-most-powerful-vacuum-cleaners\">launched its suit against the European commission last year</a>, arguing that its new system of eco-label tests misled consumers about real-world energy performance and add to environmental damage. <br /></p> <p>The new EU energy label, introduced from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/21/anger-as-eu-bans-most-powerful-vacuum-cleaners\">1 September</a>, means manufacturers are not be able to make or import vacuum cleaners with a motor that exceeds 1,600 watts.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The ECJ said in its ruling: “Dyson states that the regulation misleads consumers because the cleaning performance is tested only when the vacuum cleaner’s receptacle is empty and not during use. The court acknowledges that the suction performance and energy efficiency of a vacuum cleaner with a dust-loaded receptacle will be reduced due to dust accumulation.</p> <p>“It observes, however, that the [European] commission could not use tests conducted on the basis of a dust-loaded receptacle, as they are not reliable, accurate and reproducible, as required by the regulation.”</p> <p>The court also dismissed Dyson’s claim that current EU energy labelling laws “discriminate” in favour of bagged vacuum cleaners. <br /></p> <p>A spokesman for Dyson Ltd said the company was “reviewing its legal options, including the possibility of an appeal.”</p> <p>It said in a statement: “It is deplorable that the European Court of Justice endorses tests that don’t attempt to represent in-home use, and we believe this is causing consumers to be misled. The ECJ’s assertion that dust-loaded testing is not reliable defies belief; the dust loaded test method was devised by the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) and has been adopted by consumer test bodies and manufacturers worldwide.” </p> <p>In its highly critical statement, it went on: “By this judgment, the ECJ has given its support to unrepresentative tests devised by the commission with a small group of European manufacturers which in our view disregards the interests of consumers in Europe... The judgment is all the more surprising in view of the revelations about car testing in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/25/vw-emissions-scandal-seven-days\">VW scandal</a> where the tests do not reflect real life usage.”</p> <p>Ukip MEP Margot Parker, the party’s small business spokeswoman, said: “It is sad to see the European Court of Justice strike down a fair and reasonable complaint with such ease. Evidently the form of testing used does not allow for an equal evaluation of different types of vacuums. Unfortunately for Sir James Dyson, he has found himself on the end of yet more anti-competitive, bureaucratic and ill-conceived European regulation.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971736","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405086","internalRevision":"665","internalContentCode":"458367021","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Company says ruling is against consumer interests after court dismisses Dyson’s argument that tests discriminate in favour of bagged vacuum cleaners and lead to misleadingly high ratings","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Dyson considers appealing court rule against changing EU energy labelling laws","byline":"Rebecca Smithers","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T10:48:41Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/2030d3c714c8c0854acd70cd2bf07647c445ca00/0_38_640_384/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5643153de4b08b339848c3d4","newspaperPageNumber":"34","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-14T10:45:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Company says ruling is against consumer interests after court dismisses Dyson’s argument that tests discriminate in favour of bagged vacuum cleaners and lead to misleadingly high ratings</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T10:15:25Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T08:55:05.365Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/11/dyson-loses-court-bid-to-change-eu-energy-labelling-laws","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/11/dyson-loses-court-bid-to-change-eu-energy-labelling-laws","sectionName":"Environment","elements":[{"id":"2030d3c714c8c0854acd70cd2bf07647c445ca00","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/2030d3c714c8c0854acd70cd2bf07647c445ca00/0_38_640_384/500.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Corbis.

The problem is still very widespread in different provinces. It isn’t just concentrated in a certain area of China,” he said.</p> <p>Poon said most of those targeted were human rights lawyers, Communist party officials taken into custody by anti-corruption investigators, and practitioners of the banned spiritual movement <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/18/china-falun-gong-crackdown\">Falun Gong</a>.</p> <p>One of the most shocking cases described in the report was that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/10/the-desperate-hunt-for-li-heping-chinas-missing-human-rights-warrior\">Cai Ying</a>, a 52-year-old human rights lawyer from Hunan province. Cai claimed that after being detained in 2012 he was forced to sit on a “hanging restraint chair” – a contraption that immobilises a prisoner by dangling them in the air with their hands and chest strapped to a board.</p> <p>In a recent interview with Hong Kong’s <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/1827308/tales-torture-time-spent-chinese-police-custody-leaves-victims?page=all\">South China Morning Post</a>, Cai recalled excruciating torture sessions. “I was humiliated so badly I thought of ending it all, but then I thought of my daughter,” he said. “The humiliating experience filled my heart with hatred.”</p> <p>Yu Wensheng, another lawyer, said that after being detained last October for protesting outside a detention centre where a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/the-case-of-wang-yu-emblem-of-chinas-human-rights-crackdown\">client</a> was being held, he spent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/world/asia/china-detains-yu-wensheng-lawyer-who-accused-police-of-torture-his-wife-says.html\">more than three months in custody</a> suffering torture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed8769005ce61d61b2f6feb030d2ece012d43321\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ed8769005ce61d61b2f6feb030d2ece012d43321/126_739_2543_1526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yu Wensheng, a Chinese human rights lawyer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yu Wensheng, a Chinese human rights lawyer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yu claimed he was held with death row inmates for 61 days, during which he was questioned about 200 times. At one point officers handcuffed him to an iron chair with his hands behind his back.<br /></p> <p>“My hands were swollen and I felt so much pain that I didn’t want to live,” he was quoted as saying. “The two police officers repeatedly yanked the handcuffs. I screamed every time they pulled them.”</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian earlier this year, Yu described the despair of his time behind bars. “I felt helpless and lonely,” he said. “It is both physical and psychological suffering. I don’t think I could bear going back to jail for a long stretch again. If I get sent back to jail again, I will go on hunger strike – I would rather die than face a long spell in jail.”</p> <p>Poon said the Chinese government had taken some steps over the past five years to tackle the problem of torture. In 2012 <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-06/11/c_131645358.htm\">Beijing vowed</a> to “enforce preventive and remedial measures to prevent extortion of confession by torture and collecting evidence through illegal methods”. Xinhua, China’s official news agency, has reported on plans to introduce real-time monitoring and control management of interrogation sessions using audio and video equipment.</p> <p>However, Amnesty said such reforms had “in reality done little to change the deep-rooted practice of torturing suspects to extract forced confessions”. Chinese law outlawed only certain acts of torture and did not cover acts of mental torture, the group said. Lawyers trying to investigate or seek redress for such cases were “systematically thwarted by police, prosecutors and the courts”.</p> <p>Human rights activists believe the situation has deteriorated since President Xi Jinping <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/china-prepares-power-handover\">took control of the Communist party</a> three years ago. Xi, who some describe as China’s <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red\">most authoritarian ruler since Mao</a>, has tasked the country’s security apparatus with dismantling any potential source of opposition to the party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/the-case-of-wang-yu-emblem-of-chinas-human-rights-crackdown\">The case of Wang Yu, emblem of China's human rights crackdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/13/china-targets-lawyers-in-new-human-rights-crackdown\">renewed crackdown on human rights lawyers</a> has been under way since July, and at least 12 people – including the prominent rights lawyers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/the-case-of-wang-yu-emblem-of-chinas-human-rights-crackdown\">Wang Yu</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/10/the-desperate-hunt-for-li-heping-chinas-missing-human-rights-warrior\">Li Heping</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/04/zhang-kai-chinese-human-rights-lawyer-could-face-spying-charges\">Zhang Kai</a> – are still being held in undisclosed locations on state security charges. Activists fear those prisoners are likely to be suffering psychological and possibly physical torture.</p> <p>“The government’s attitude to lawyers has become even more hostile than before under [former president] Hu Jintao,” said Poon. “If they continue to crack down on lawyers and to allow this kind of torture to happen, it won’t help maintain social stability but will only create even more social unrest. If lawyers face such treatment, imagine ordinary people.”</p> <p>Asked to comment on the Amnesty report,a foreign ministry spokesman said China was working to bring “fairness and justice” to all. </p> <p>“China is a country governed by the rule of law,” the spokesman said at a press briefing on Thursday. “Extracting confessions through torture is explicitly banned by China’s laws. Anyone found using torture during interrogation will be subject to punishment.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Christy Yao </em></p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971360","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405203","internalRevision":"565","internalContentCode":"458367810","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Report details alleged beatings and torture endured by those taken into police custody despite government pledges to reform ","allowUgc":"false","headline":"China still uses medieval torture methods against opponents – Amnesty","byline":"Tom Phillips in Beijing","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T22:00:02Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/803111b894a7732396ff03e5d6f448a568222ed4/0_0_2500_1499/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56432b2ae4b091514c06d57e","newspaperPageNumber":"23","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-14T22:00:02Z","standfirst":"<p>Report details alleged beatings and torture endured by those taken into police custody despite government pledges to reform </p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T11:48:58Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T09:34:39.617Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/china-still-uses-medieval-torture-methods-against-opponents-amnesty","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/nov/11/china-still-uses-medieval-torture-methods-against-opponents-amnesty","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"803111b894a7732396ff03e5d6f448a568222ed4","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/803111b894a7732396ff03e5d6f448a568222ed4/0_0_2500_1499/140.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/803111b894a7732396ff03e5d6f448a568222ed4","altText":"A composite showing illustrations of weapons allegedly used in China for torture and forced confessions.

over 50 years ago a generation of young British musicians, including the members of the Rolling Stones, grappled with the distinctive descending chord progression of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2wT9ZVnFr4\" title=\"\">Fortune Teller</a>, a rhythm and blues hit written by the New Orleans pianist <a href=\"http://allentoussaint.com/\" title=\"\">Allen Toussaint</a>, while memorising its hip, humorous lyric. This was one of the many songs, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5psXvh8dVYk\" title=\"\">Working in the Coal Mine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCscZ2tPFmI\" title=\"\">Southern Nights</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP3YhOzb74k\" title=\"\">Yes We Can Can</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-i3PLJQvno\" title=\"\">Get Out of My Life, Woman</a>, that poured from his pen.</p> <p>Toussaint, who has died after a heart attack aged 77, was one of popular music’s great backroom figures: a talent scout, record producer, studio owner, singer and arranger. His early proteges included the singers Lee Dorsey, <a href=\"http://www.irmathomas.com/\" title=\"\">Irma Thomas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jul/10/guardianobituaries3\" title=\"\">Ernie K-Doe</a>, and he went on to collaborate with some of the great names of rock, including the Band, Paul McCartney, LaBelle, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/27/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Robert Palmer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.elviscostello.com/\" title=\"\">Elvis Costello</a>.</p> <p>Showing a precocious understanding of the predatory machinations of the music industry, He formed his own companies at the start of his career and took firm control of his own destiny – at least until his home and its contents were washed away by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/01/naturaldisasters.hurricanekatrina\" title=\"\">Hurricane Katrina</a> in 2005. The disaster forced him to embark on an unexpected but highly successful second career as a performer.</p> <p>Toussaint was born in Gert Town, a district of New Orleans populated mostly by African Americans. Both his parents loved music. His father, Clarence, a railway worker, played the trumpet with a big band at weekends and his mother, Naomi, loved opera. As a child Toussaint became steeped in gospel music and, inspired by Albert Ammons and Pinetop Smith, learned to play boogie-woogie on the piano, before exposure to the records of another pianist, Professor Longhair, reshaped his ambitions. His mother sent him at the age of eight for piano tuition in the junior music school of Xavier University of Louisiana, Gert Town. After barely half a dozen lessons, however, she withdrew him. “It’s too late,” he remembered her saying. “The boogie-woogie’s got him.”</p> <p>He was 13 when he and a friend, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/20/snooks-eaglin-obituary\" title=\"\">Snooks Eaglin</a>, who played the guitar, formed a group called the Flamingos, playing at school dances. At 17 he attracted attention while playing at the Dew Drop Inn in New Orleans, and deputised for Huey “Piano” Smith, a local hero, with the band of the guitarist <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/21/arts/earl-king-new-orleans-bluesman-dies-at-69.html\" title=\"\">Earl King</a>. Soon he was recruited by the local bandleader Dave Bartholomew, Fats Domino’s musical director and a noted talent-spotter. His first hit as a producer, in 1957, came with the saxophonist Lee Allen’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhi1X7LZDNs\" title=\"\">Walking With Mr Lee</a>.</p> <p>In 1958 he recorded his debut album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvhT_tyPaMs&amp;list=PLUSRfoOcUe4Y-cBwKQMYG5asMMHJGdfXh\" title=\"\">The Wild Sound of New Orleans</a>, a set of piano-led instrumental pieces on which he was billed as Tousan. Two years later he was hired to recruit and groom new talent for the Minit label, where his early productions included Jessie Hill’s wild <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qhxE5z9xRI\" title=\"\">Ooh Poo Pah Doo</a>, Chris Kenner’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVJZKb9SCLA\" title=\"\">I Like It Like That</a> and the Showmen’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa17h1n5kCw\" title=\"\">It Will Stand</a>. He wrote and produced Fortune Teller and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw3sGtfwwYM\" title=\"\">Lipstick Traces (On a Cigarette)</a> for Benny Spellman, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EN5eJf5h_k\" title=\"\">Mother-in-Law</a> for Ernie K-Doe, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g2ZAsTIefc\" title=\"\">Ruler of My Heart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNZFbgszrVY\" title=\"\">It’s Raining</a> for Irma Thomas.</p> <p>In 1961, his production of a semi-nonsense song called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5LnpErE6f4\" title=\"\">Ya Ya</a> opened a long string of successes with the singer Lee Dorsey. “He had a happy voice and he wasn’t too cool to sing a humorous song,” Toussaint said, adding that his own compositions were usually tailored to the personality of the singer. “Many times I wait until the artist is near and I can see them, see how they feel about themselves, how they would like to feel about themselves.”</p> <p>Toussaint was drafted into the US army in 1963, but a windfall came when the popular trumpeter <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/28/arts/al-hirt-76-trumpeter-and-symbol-of-new-orleans-dies.html\" title=\"\">Al Hirt</a> had a Top 5 hit with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqwIpH6phJs\" title=\"\">Java</a>, a tune from Toussaint’s first album. Another of his instrumental pieces, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u68NMAI_Js\" title=\"\">Whipped Cream</a>, became the title track of an album by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass in 1964.</p> <p>After two years in the army he returned to the studio with undiminished success, producing the early recordings of the Meters, featuring Art Neville, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_iC0MyIykM\" title=\"\">Cissy Strut</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPjZ_KpwXH8\" title=\"\">Look-Ka Py Py</a>. In 1970 he was encouraged to try a career as a singer, releasing the first of three albums for the Warner Brothers label. He provided horn arrangements for the Band’s famous 1971 concerts at the Academy of Music in New York, and produced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R44PkPUEDCM\" title=\"\">In the Right Place</a>, a hit album for his old protege Mac Rebennack, better known as Dr John.</p> <p>In 1972, with his business partner, a sales and promotion man named <a href=\"http://www.charliegillett.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=3500\" title=\"\">Marshall Sehorn</a>, he founded Sea-Saint Studio. There he produced the young British soul singers Robert Palmer, <a href=\"http://www.jessroden.com/\" title=\"\">Jess Roden</a> and <a href=\"http://www.frankiemiller.net/index.htm\" title=\"\">Frankie Miller</a>. Little Feat recorded his blues-ballad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE5Ve0y0m1Y\" title=\"\">On Your Way Down</a>, and Boz Scaggs had a hit with the plaintive <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW7XupYBdDw\" title=\"\">What Do You Want the Girl to Do</a>. In 1974 Toussaint arranged and produced LaBelle’s New Orleans-flavoured disco classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LWIP7SAjY\" title=\"\">Lady Marmalade</a>, and a year later he played on McCartney’s album Venus and Mars.</p> <p>After fleeing the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he spent two years exiled in New York. There he collaborated with Elvis Costello on an album about the disaster called The River in Reverse (2006), and his late-blooming career as a performer began when he accepted an offer to play a regular Sunday brunch session at an East Village pub. “I never thought of myself as a performer,” he told me last year. “My comfort zone is behind the scenes.” But his gentle voice, his exquisite piano-playing, the vast repertoire of songs full of wry wisdom, his dandyish wardrobe and his elder-statesman charm made him a great attraction at festivals and clubs around the world. In 2013 he collaborated on <a href=\"http://www.twylatharp.org/content/waiting-station\" title=\"\">a ballet</a> with the choreographer Twyla Tharp and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe5huJ_0f6Y\" title=\"\">received the National Medal of Arts</a> from President Barack Obama.</p> <p>It was in a Madrid hotel room, shortly after a performance, that he died. He had been due to perform in London this Sunday and in New Orleans next month with Paul Simon, at a benefit for <a href=\"http://noaahh.org/\" title=\"\">a charity for the hungry and homeless</a> that he co-founded in the city 40 years ago.</p> <p>He is survived by a daughter, Alison, a son, Clarence, and six grandchildren.</p> <p>• Allen Toussaint, musician, born 14 January 1938; died 9

three years as it steps up its store expansion with new-look outlets that include self-checkouts – and customer toilets.</p> <p>The German discounter said it was aiming to open 40-50 stores a year in the UK, up from the 30-40 previously planned and the 20 opened in 2014.</p> <p>The fast-growing company, which has helped revolutionise British shopping habits, will also refurbish up to 150 existing sites to its “store of the future” concept over the next three to four years.</p> <p>Lidl will open the first £2m store of the future in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Thursday. The 1,400 sq metres building is one of the first Lidl stores in the UK with customer toilets, baby changing facilities and self-checkouts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b6f0dcf5ab80baf63f2e385c70a7c2c37a5b905a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b6f0dcf5ab80baf63f2e385c70a7c2c37a5b905a/0_138_2121_1276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lidl is revamping its wine departments.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"602\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lidl is revamping its wine departments.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lidl</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These features, common in mainstream supermarkets, mark a move upmarket for the discounter chain. The new stores will also feature longer tills so customers can pack at the checkout, wider aisles and glass frontages to make them lighter.</p> <p>Bryan Roberts, at retail the analysis firm Kantar, said the Rushden store combined features that Lidl had tested in a handful of other stores. The introduction of bakeries, deluxe food ranges and revamped wine departments were designed to appeal to middle-class shoppers, he said.</p> <p>“Lidl is definitely chasing a more upmarket clientele as well as its traditional shopper base,” Roberts said. “The worry is that it is adding costs and complexity into a model where the heritage has always been being brutally efficient with a very narrow [range of products]. Arguably, the distinction between a supermarket and a discounter is ebbing away.”</p> <p>Ingo Fischer, Lidl UK’s board director of property and expansion, said the new stores would improve efficiency and help streamline the group’s processes. “This forms a key part of our business model, which enables us to keep prices low and the quality of our products high,” he said.</p> <p>As well as wider aisles, the stores will include better facilities such as improved staff rooms andenergy efficient LED lighting. Lidl plans to recycle heat from its refrigerators to warm the store so its operations are cheaper and greener than traditional outlets.<br tabindex=\"-1\"

evening of 26 June last year, the flat was empty. Her wife Mariahad left behind the climbing ropes tied to the bunk-bed of their six-year-old son, Kostya, and a portrait she had done of him. There were also Kostya’s crayon drawings at child height, just above the skirting boards: Angry Birds, and the Swedish cartoon Carlsen. All other traces of Pasha’s wife and son were gone.</p> <p>“I had a premonition in the morning,” Pasha told me. “Maria just seemed too keen to get me out of the house. When I came home and saw them gone, I knew immediately what had happened. I became hysterical. I tried to phone Maria many times, but she would not pick up.”</p> <p>A year later, in July 2015, at her ground-floor flat in a block of flats in Lyubertsy, an industrial suburb south-east of Moscow, Pasha was leaning against the bunk bed in Kostya’s neat and empty room, now the sombre chapel to a lost child. Tall and athletic, Pasha hid her striking beauty behind androgynous reddish hair that fell in a low fringe over her face. After gender reassignment surgery, she had changed her surname to the female form, but had kept her first name as “Pasha”, the gender-neutral diminutive of both the male Pavel and the female Pavla. She was low from the grief of losing her child and side effects that still made it painful to walk six months after her surgery. She spoke in a whisper, an attempt perhaps to feminise her voice, but she was firm in her resolve to see her son. She had devoted herself to appealing against the Moscow regional court’s decision to deny her custody.</p> <p>Pasha tried repeatedly to contact her wife after she left. When she finally managed to get hold of her, Maria had said: “There’s nothing to worry about. We’re doing OK.”</p> <p>“What about me?” Pasha asked.</p> <p>“Now you’re free to live as you choose.”</p> <p>In a cruel way, Maria was right. For years, Pasha had been deferring any thought of changing her gender. Like so many transgender people, she feared that she would be compelled to forfeit her family. Now, however, she realised that she had nothing more to lose. She got involved in protesting against Russia’s new anti-LGBT laws, and a friend she had met through this activism introduced her to a couple who ran a gender clinic in a northern Moscow suburb, where she began her transition. She made her submission to a board of six doctors led by a psychiatrist, received a medical diagnosis of “gender identity disorder”, underwent vaginoplasty surgery, and then, finally, the arduous process of persuading the Russian authorities to change her documents (there is no standard procedure for this, and it depends largely on the caprice of the local functionary).</p> <p>Her son Kostya has since told a state-appointed psychological observation team that the person who used to be his beloved father was now a “crazy woman” who would corrupt him with her “femishness”<strong> </strong>(these are both rough translations of vulgar Russian slang).</p> <p>In the months before Maria left, Russia’s federal parliament had considered a bill that would give the state permission to remove children from parents in “non-traditional” relationships. The bill was withdrawn, but the panic it caused had not receded. In an increasingly nationalistic and socially conservative Russia, where any mention of homosexuality around minors is criminalised as “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/russia-law-banning-gay-propaganda\">gay propaganda</a>” and both homosexuality and transgenderism are condemned as signs of decadent western influence, Pasha’s transition has estranged her further from her son.</p> <p>Ironically, it was Kostya’s birth that rekindled Pasha’s understanding that she was destined to be a woman; a feeling she had repressed since she was about 10 years old. Like many transgender children, she did not understand why she was referred to as a boy and expected to do typically male things. But she was naturally athletic, and her passion was shooting: she loved the focus and the “tranquillity” of marksmanship. “I put my femininity deep inside, in a little box, and it was invisible to the outside,” she told me. “My life was like that scene in The Terminator. Schwarzenegger is looking at a screen, and figuring out what his options are. There are several options, and the most appropriate one is highlighted. I acted in the way that would be most appropriate, to avoid problems.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My life was like that scene in The Terminator. Schwarzenegger is looking at a screen, and figuring out his options</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pasha became The Terminator: “Military service: highlighted. So I went to the army and became a sniper. Husband: highlighted. So I married Maria. Fatherhood: highlighted. So we had Kostya.”</p> <p>But when the child was born, “all my female feelings rose up again. I just felt a big love for this little creature, and I wanted to protect him.” Given her training as a sniper, Pasha was employed, at first, by the Russian National Guard, protecting sensitive sites, but she quit this work after seven years.<strong> </strong>At the time of Kostya’s birth, she worked largely from home, as an IT consultant. She led a reclusive life, while Maria was a party-girl with a senior management job. And so Pasha became Kostya’s primary parent: “But people thought that men should not act this way. I was rebuked for being too soft, too caring, not manly enough as a father. This shocked and confused me, and over time I came to the conclusion that the suppression of these feelings was being imposed on me. Once I understood this, I realised that I had the power to reject it. Society did not have the right to manage how I felt … If I wanted to cry, I would cry. If I wanted to be happy, I’d have fun. I freed my consciousness from everything imposed on me. That’s when I accepted myself as a woman.”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>After Kostya was born, </strong>Pasha spent a lot of time reading about her rights and her medical options on the internet. This was a time when, globally, awareness about transgenderism was expanding dramatically. A new LGBT rights movement was flexing its muscles in Russia too, and Pasha watched, at first from a distance, as LGBT Pride marches were attempted, but dispersed. She told her wife how she felt, and what she wanted to do. Maria was supportive at first. But once the anti-gay propaganda law was enacted in Russia, everything changed.</p> <p>Pasha was deeply troubled by the new state-sanctioned homophobia of President Vladimir Putin’s followers, and their calls for the recriminalisation of homosexuality and the denial of transgender rights. The “gay propaganda” law had been on the books of the province of Ryazan since 2006; during 2012 it was piloted in several other places, including St Petersburg, and by the end of that year, the federal parliament announced its intention to make it national law. Anyone promoting “non-traditional relationships” in front of minors would be subject to a fine of up to 100,000 roubles (£1,000). The law was passed in June 2013: it has seldom been applied, but it has provoked extreme homophobia, including entrapments using online dating services, violent disruptions of public gatherings and, in one instance in St Petersburg, a shooting at a gay community centre that left one young man blind.</p> <p>When parliament started debating the bill in late 2012, LGBT activists and their supporters demonstrated in Moscow. Pasha began to attend. This outraged Maria, who was determined to keep Pasha’s new identity secret. “Imagine if someone Maria knew saw Pasha on television at one of these demonstrations!” a family friend said to me. “She could never have lived with the shame. She was also, correctly, worried that the child might be teased.” (Maria did not respond to my requests for an interview.)</p> <p>At the same time, Pasha told me, “on TV they started showing all these horrible programmes that said homosexuality is harmful, it’s an illness coming from the west aimed at the destruction of Russia from within.” In one prime-time programme, aired in late 2012, a group of seemingly deranged cross-dressers were alleged to be in the service of a Ukrainian plot to undermine Russia.<strong> </strong>Maria had been quite progressive and democratic before, but her views began to change.</p> <p>Pasha had begun to take oestrogen (without supervision: prescription compliance is very lax in Russia) and to use a breast-enhancing cream. On a holiday in the countryside, during the spring of 2014, Maria’s aunt – a doctor – figured out what was happening, and revealed it to the extended family. Her belief was that Pasha was mentally ill. Pasha’s mother-in-law was upset and angry.</p> <p>A few weeks later, Maria left with Kostya, and filed for divorce. The divorce was granted quickly, and although Maria was given custody of the boy, as biological mothers almost always are, Pasha’s rights to access were confirmed. In the summer of 2014, Pasha saw her son about a dozen times, but always in a public park, and always with a phalanx of Maria’s relatives in attendance. When Kostya and his relations did not show up for the next meeting, Pasha called and was told the boy was ill: she went over to the flat where Maria’s parents live with gifts for her son, but was denied entry.</p> <p>When Pasha wrote about these incidents in a Facebook post, Maria’s family accused her of airing dirty laundry in public and shut down access to Kostya altogether. The last time Pasha saw her son was on 12 August last year, at his birthday party in a public park: she was allowed to give him his gifts, but the boy was whisked away – crying for his father, Pasha claims – before she could talk to him. Pasha was not invited to his birthday party this year, and she heard, via her stepmother – who received occasional calls from Maria’s grandmother – that the gifts she sent were distributed to other children.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Pasha’s stepmother, Valentina Kuziminichinska</strong>, is a short, thick-set woman in her 70s, a retired hairdresser and factory worker, with cropped hair and that singular combination of heartiness and sentimentality that defines the Russian <em>babushka</em>. She arrived at Pasha’s flat one humid afternoon last July, bearing fresh fruit from the market, to hear the latest news: Pasha had not only lost her appeal against the custody decision, but had received a call from Maria’s lawyer, telling her that she could no longer see Kostya at all, since the psychologist’s report had said that this would be “destabilising” for the child.</p> <p>Valentina was outraged: “I am so pained by this. I am furious!” She threw her arms around “my Pasha” and pinched Pasha’s cheeks: “She has always been my child. I loved her when she was my son, and now I love her as my daughter.” She volunteered: “Of course this is not traditional for our country, this is not conventional. We have our own traditions and conventions here in Russia, not like you in the west. But you have to be human in every situation.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I loved her when she was my son, and now I love her as my daughter. This is not conventional. But you have to be human</p> <footer> <cite>Valentina</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Valentina had struggled with Pasha’s identity at first, but had become her staunchest defender: “How could I possibly turn my back on my own child, when mothers of murderers still visit their children in jail? My Pasha is not a criminal! She is my child and I must support her now that the whole world is against her.” As at several points in her visit, emotion overwhelmed her: “The police can’t stop me! I’m going to go over there [to Maria’s parents’ flat] and punch them in the face!”</p> <p>The neighbours in Pasha’s building were shocked by her transition, but not hostile. We went to visit an elderly woman named Natalya Efseyeva, who embraced Pasha and told me: “I could see him changing, but I didn’t want to pry. But then you get snatches of things on the TV, and you discover that such things happen, and that – heavens! – your neighbour, the little Pasha you have known since he was a little boy, is one of those!” Some people in the building did gossip about Pasha, she said, but “it’s not malicious. We don’t know the reasons, so we let it go. If he was immoral, or loose, we’d be much more judgmental. But Pasha’s such a good person. Sometimes a guy just becomes a girl, I guess. It happens. That’s life. Who are we to judge God’s will? You must remember we have all known him since he was a little boy.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e1900dd840c83270353e326ea77ace4378180a0c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e1900dd840c83270353e326ea77ace4378180a0c/0_75_5616_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pasha (right) and her stepmother Valentina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pasha (right) and her stepmother Valentina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Pleshkova/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pasha had, in fact, lived in the flat since she was four years old and her own father had taken custody of her, removing her from an alcoholic mother. Pasha’s only memory of her biological mother was sitting on the floor with a toy and watching her back at the kitchen table where she was getting drunk, a consequence of what Pasha now understands as a severe and untreated post-natal depression. When her father came home from a business trip and found Pasha in hospital owing to the mother’s neglect, he took his child to live with his own parents, in the Lyubertsy flat (which Pasha now owns). Soon thereafter, Pasha’s father met Valentina, a widow with a 10-year-old son: they moved in together. Pasha idolised her father, an engineer at the nearby MIL helicopter plant, who died in 1995. He was a gentle man, she said, who encouraged her to think for herself.</p> <p>Pasha followed a similar approach to parenting and, in fact, the conflict with Maria and her family had started over this, some time before Pasha’s coming out: “Maria’s parents are very old-school, and they often criticised Pasha for being too soft,” the family friend told me. “But Pasha actually communicated with the child, while Maria, more often, scolded him. Pasha was the one who could calm Kostya down.”</p> <p>Pasha framed her determination to gain custody of Kostya as a way of saving the child: “He is being treated like clay, to be shaped into anything they want. If I raise him, he will be free to make his own choices about what he wants to be, what he thinks of others.”</p> <p>The state-appointed psychological panel’s assessment of Kostya, commissioned as a consequence of Pasha’s custody appeal, reported that the six-year-old expressed “a wish to beat his father, using his new martial skills”. The boy described his friends as “real men”, with “balls”, “learning to fight … in a battle”. His grandfather, also one of these “real men”, had told him that “Dad is now wearing braids and earrings and hairclips … and needs to be taught what’s what.” Kostya also reported that “Mum will not let me see Dad, because he could infect me with his illness.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"82c285acf2d18f99c46e518086b11ce57ea1fe38\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/82c285acf2d18f99c46e518086b11ce57ea1fe38/0_0_3673_5509/667.jpg\" alt=\"Pasha sits beneath a portrait of her son.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pasha sits beneath a portrait of her son.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Pleshkova/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The psychologists declined to give an official assessment of the relationship between Pasha and Kostya, because they had not observed them together. But they refused to put the two of them together for the purposes of such assessment, as it might upset the child. “Unfortunately, Pasha’s attempts to gain custody have made things worse for her,” said her legal adviser, Tatyana Glushkova, a celebrated human rights lawyer who has fought several cases for the <a href=\"https://www.lgbtnet.ru/en\">Russian LGBT Network</a>. “There is now expert evidence that the child is troubled by the father becoming a woman, so now, if Pasha tries to exercise her rights, the mother can use this evidence to limit access.” This is exactly what Maria has done.</p> <p>Pasha’s only recourse at this point, is to fight for access: she obtained a letter from the State Custodial Service stating that Maria was being uncooperative. If Maria continued to deny Pasha access to her child, said Glushkova, a case could be taken to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. At the time of writing, all Pasha’s attempts to gain access to Kostya had come to nothing.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Although gender has nothing to do with sexuality</strong>, transgender people in Russia are often seen as the most visible manifestation of what is now widely regarded as the “perversion” of homosexuality, and are thus particularly vulnerable. There are very few places they can feel safe. The gender clinic Pasha attended is one of them. It is owned and run by a married couple, Andrei and Yael Demedov, who are both transgender themselves. The Demedovs have also set up a community centre for transgender people in a stately corner of Old Moscow, in the basement of a large Stalin-era apartment block. I went to visit them there one weekday evening.</p> <p>At the bottom of a stairwell accessed through an unmarked locked door, there was a shop, which seemed at first glance to be filled with the standard cross-dressing apparel: sexy underwear, sequinned frocks, incredibly high heels, walls of wigs. But it had, on closer inspection, everything a transgender man or woman might need: accoutrements sober as well as wild, makeup, falsies, breast-binders, packers. There was also a large meeting room and a suite of treatment rooms staffed by depilation therapists. In the few hours I was there, someone who looked like a middle-aged man rang the buzzer, came downstairs, disappeared into the back, reappeared made up and dressed as a woman, hung around the seating area for a while, offered us tea, disappeared again, reappeared in men’s clothing, and said goodbye. They clearly did not want to leave. They were wearing a wedding ring.</p> <p>Yael, in her late 40s, was several years older than Andrei. She too had lost access to her son when she began transitioning, she told me, and had not seen him in over a decade: “Pasha’s story is a common one in our community,” she said to me. “But what makes her unique is that she is trying to fight.”</p> <p>Yael had been a successful financial analyst before her transition in 2009, and had launched a transgender website a few years previously, which she subsidised by selling accessories and clothing, an enterprise that formalised into the shop, and then the dermatological clinic. Then, two years ago, the Demedovs set up the full-spectrum surgery, where Pasha had her surgery. They found a psychiatrist and convened an assessment panel, which was granted a licence by the state to give gender identity disorder diagnoses. They also enlisted the services of medical consultants to do the procedures, and persuaded them to perform them at a significantly lower cost than other private facilities. Pasha’s surgery cost 200,000 roubles (£2,000), about two-thirds of the price she would have paid anywhere else. The Demedov clinic does between 300 and 400 gender reassignment surgeries a year: about two-thirds of these are male to female, and one third female to male. Most of the former are orchidectomies (testicle removal), rather than full vaginoplasties, as these are much cheaper, and will be enough proof of the “irrevocable change” for recipients to change their documents officially.</p> <p>All the transgender people I spoke to in Moscow told of how dramatically transphobia had increased since the passage of the gay propaganda bill. There is bizarre new legislation that prevents transgender people from obtaining driving licences. Earlier this year, Russia’s most illustrious psychiatrist dealing with gender reassignment, Dmitri Isaev, was forced to resign from his state-run medical institution in St Petersburg and to disband his gender assessment board, because of complaints from conservative activists. There are now only four assessment boards in operation across Russia. Dr Nadezhda Solov’yova, who runs the board connected to the Demedov clinic, told me: “We are worried. This is a witch hunt. We realise that at some point this might reach us.”</p> <p>While the Demedovs’ basement community centre was unmarked, their surgery in northern Moscow advertised itself, on windows facing a typical Moscow suburban courtyard, with the outline of a woman’s face and the vague words “Medical Clinic”. Inside was a reception room, a consulting room, a theatre, and a small ward. In this last room, with two beds overlooking a garden, Pasha had recuperated for a week, before she was transferred to a general hospital, for another three painful weeks, because of complications arising from of her surgery.</p> <p>When I met with Solov’yova at the clinic, she remembered Pasha’s assessment, one of about 200 she had done since 2012: “We deemed her to be adaptable, communicative, capable of new skills of socialisation. She was not depressive. The thing we concentrate most on is excluding any underlying psychopathology, such as schizophrenia, for example, which might manifest as transgenderism.”</p> <p>A small number of applicants to Solov’yova’s board have been turned down: “It’s a responsibility we have to take seriously,” Yael told me, recounting the case of a woman who seemed determined to transition because she had fallen in love with a gay man: “What if we had proceeded? What, then, if she had fallen out of love with this man and then regretted it?”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To change your gender, you have to be so balanced, level-headed, stress-resistant. It's not for the fainthearted</p> <footer> <cite>Pasha</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Solov’yova, a brisk and affable woman in her 40s, is a specialist in treating dementia, and had not dealt with transgenderism before being recruited by the Demedovs. She told me that what has struck her most about her new cohort of patients was that “to go through these trials, these tests, to change your gender, you actually have to be healthier than most ordinary people. They have to be so balanced, level headed, stress-resistant. It’s not for the fainthearted.”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Pasha has the makings of a new family.</strong> In her June 2015 submission to the court to counter Pasha’s suit to regain custody of Kostya, Maria wrote that one of the reasons that the child should not be returned to his biological father was because “Pavel is residing together in a flat with a woman who accepts a homosexual lesbian relationship.”</p> <p>Pasha met Anya in November 2014, two weeks before she went for her surgery, at a conference on LGBT families in Moscow. Anya, who is married with a teenage son, comes from a Russian city in the Volga region, an eight-hour train ride away. She told me that she too had been mobilised by the gay propaganda legislation. As a devout Christian, she had been horrified by the way that hate speech had found its way into church sermons: “Russia had begun to resemble fascist Germany, the singling out of a vulnerable group. I asked myself: ‘Who will be next?’”<strong> </strong></p> <p>Anya is a psychologist who specialises in adolescence. Her response was to go online and volunteer her professional services to a remarkable initiative founded by a young journalist named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/29/lgbt-yelena-klimova-fined-russia-gay-propaganda-laws\">Elena Klimova</a>: an organisation named Deti-404, that had set up pages on Facebook and VKontakte, its Russian equivalent, for LGBT youth to tell their stories and chat with each other.<strong> </strong>In July, Klimova was fined 50,000 roubles for contravening the propaganda law herself, and ordered to shut down her pages. She did not comply.</p> <p>Anya provides online counselling to the young people who contact Deti-404, and it was in this capacity that she had come to Moscow to attend the conference last November. She and Pasha had connected instantly. When the conference was over, Anya returned to her job and her family, but when Pasha was discharged from hospital in early January and was unable to care for herself, Anya dropped everything and came to Moscow. She planned to be in town for a few days, but she stayed for six weeks. Ever since, she had been dividing her time between Moscow and the Volga. When she was back home, she and Pasha would hang out on Skype for hours every day; when she was in Moscow, she and Pasha did the same with her 16-year-old son Vova and her husband, too, if he was around.<strong> </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1504fd10d6bc2c2d3df205f8f1d30b0b8e59b689\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1504fd10d6bc2c2d3df205f8f1d30b0b8e59b689/0_185_5081_3049/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pasha (right) with her partner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pasha (right) with her partner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Pleshkova/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With her cascade of blonde hair, her full figure and her sparkling blue eyes, Anya looks as if she has stepped out of a Soviet-era poster. When I met her with Pasha last summer, they seemed like two women in the first flush of love. Out and about, they were always hand-in-hand or arm-in-arm, oblivious to the looks they sometimes attracted. Being with Pasha, Anya told me, freed her from the gender stereotypes imposed on her: “For most of my life I tried to force myself to believe I could live as a normal female, you know, making meatballs and raising a family, but that would only last for a week or two and I’d find myself back doing some sort of social project – something a man is supposed to do. With Pasha, I don’t have those internal stereotypes. I can just be myself.” She and her husband lived separate lives, she said, although they still lived in the same home and raised their son together.</p> <p>Vova studied English and read it fluently, and so Anya often asked him to do translations for her. One of these was the much-circulated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crHHycz7T_c\">Human Rights Campaign award speech</a> of the American transgender film director Lana Warshowski earlier this year. When Anya wanted to explain to Vova who Pasha was, she referred back to this video. He shrugged in a noncommittal adolescent way.</p> <p>Now, a few months later, she had brought him to Moscow to be with her and Pasha during his summer holidays, and she was deeply anxious about how everyone would get along. “But really,” Anya laughed, “I can see that this my concern and nobody else’s. They’re both introverts, but you’d never guess it when you see them together. They talk about computers, and games, and weapons, and Vova’s work as a Wiki moderator. I don’t understand a word of it, but Pasha offers a lot of insight, and it thrills Vova. It’s only been a couple of days, and already they are old friends.”</p> <p>When I met them in the Lyubertsy flat, Vova was staying in Kostya’s old room, and Pasha seemed pleased with this: “I look at him and I see my own child in many ways. I think they even look similar. And they communicate in the same sort of way: quite shy at first, but then when they warm to you, they really come to life.”</p> <p>Vova was indeed a shy kid, handsome and studious, with a dry sense of humour and an ironic gallantry around his mother and her new girlfriend. He did not remember the Warshowski video, and could not even remember a “moment” when he became aware of trans people, or homosexual people: “She told me once that she works with people like that. She spoke about it in such a natural way that I did not exactly register when it happened.”</p> <p>Vova clearly adores his mother, and admitted that he found her long absences difficult to deal with. What would happen were Anya to bring Pasha home, I asked? “No,” he responded. “That would be very difficult.”</p> <p>A couple of days later, we all wandered around Gorky Park together, and ate pizza at a riverside cafe. Anya and Pasha had exchanged rings, and liked to fantasise about a wedding ceremony – perhaps in Denmark, a favourite destination for same-sex Russian couples. I told them that I came from South Africa, where same-sex marriage was legal, and that I was married to my male partner. Why not come to Cape Town to do it?</p> <p>“That is a very good idea,” said Vova, deadpan. “Get one-way tickets, please.”</p> <p>Everybody laughed.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>In August, Anya took Vova back to the Volga,</strong> for him to start the school year at his new senior high school, where he would specialise in maths.</p> <p>Back in the Moscow region, Kostya, just seven years old, started primary school. On 2 September, Pasha posted the following on her Facebook wall:</p> <blockquote> <p>My Dear, Dear Child,<br />All I want now is to be with you on this very important day, your first day at school. To be able to hug you and give you the support you need. I wish you success in everything. <br />I love you infinitely and beyond measure.<br />I am watching smartly-dressed children on the streets walking to school, accompanied by their parents, and I envy them. I have been denied this important day in my life, and nothing will ever make up for that!</p> </blockquote> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed to protect identities.</em></p> <p><em>This article has been launched with comments switched off.

trafficking is an evil we like to think happens somewhere else; in impoverished countries, or if nearer to home only as part of activity that is generally illegal – the sex trade perhaps, but not the mainstream economy. It is a jolt to be confronted with evidence suggesting that human trafficking for labour exploitation – a form of modern slavery – may be happening under our noses and in relation to goods that we ourselves consume.</p> <p>The Guardian has uncovered suspected cases of undocumented African and Asian migrant workers being trafficked into the Irish prawn and white fish fleet as part of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/02/revealed-trafficked-migrant-workers-abused-in-irish-fishing-industry\" title=\"\">wider investigation into the exploitation of undocumented migrants in fishing</a>. We know that similar allegations are being investigated by police as part of a formal inquiry into trafficking in the Scottish fishing fleet.</p> <p>The reaction in Ireland has been one of shock. But it has fallen into two camps: <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/exploitation-within-irish-fishing-indistry-is-no-surprise-1.2415838\" title=\"\">those who say the problem has been an open secret</a> for years, including among <a href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/ourview/exploitation-we-pretend-not-to-see--people-trafficking-in-ireland-362913.html\" title=\"\">leading Irish media groups who have bravely covered the issue in the past</a>, and those, some of them connected to the industry, who say <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/fishermen-may-sue-over-newspapers-migrants-claims-34172138.html\" title=\"\">the reports are exaggerated</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/02/revealed-trafficked-migrant-workers-abused-in-irish-fishing-industry\">Revealed: trafficked migrant workers abused in Irish fishing industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What many of those we spoke to in Ireland during the year-long investigation found hard to accept was that some of the exploitation reported to us might be a problem of slavery, although human rights groups and the seafarers’ union are convinced that is what it is. African and Asian workers wanted to come, they said. Employers were doing them a favour. They were happy to live on trawlers – even though the pay was often a fraction of what locals might earn for the same work – because it was nevertheless more than they could ever earn at home. They might be working illegally and be undocumented, but they were friends, like family. That can’t be slavery, surely?</p> <p>Most of the migrant workers we interviewed, by contrast, conveyed a sense of constant fear, feeling trapped by their lack of immigration status. They also conveyed a sense of deep degradation. We did not attempt to put figures on the scale of trafficking – measuring something that is hidden and illegal is, by definition, impossible. Any figures that do emerge should, like all statistics on irregular immigration, be treated with caution. Undocumented migrant workers who are being exploited tend not to appear on the mandatory crew logs. Some talked clearly, however, of being treated as though they were less than human, or as second-class citizens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64251a410da4f62483a0a27b892e05931efb2ca9\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/64251a410da4f62483a0a27b892e05931efb2ca9/0_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker mends nets on an Irish trawler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker mends nets on an Irish fishing trawler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mat Heywood for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Legal definitions of slavery have changed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/27/human-traffickers-face-life-sentence-britain-slavery-bill\" title=\"\">New legislation in the UK</a> and amended legislation in Ireland aims to recognise that slavery today is not limited to chattel slavery and violent control. The new laws recognise that victims may have consented to their initial journeys, and that control may be exercised in other ways than the physical. A good analogy is the change in legal definitions of rape in recent decades. We no longer think of rape as confined to cases involving violent attack by a stranger. We accept that there can also be rape where a victim has agreed to meet and have some sort of relationship with the other person but not consented to sex.</p> <p>Modern slavery can encompass more subtle forms of coercion and control: where a victim’s vulnerability or lack of choice has been abused; where there is a hold over family back home through debt; or where the threat of deportation deprives them of any real freedom and choice once they have been brought in. They may be paid for some of their work but be forced to do extra unpaid labour. Determining when an individual is a victim of slavery as it is newly defined depends on the detail of their experience. To distinguish it from the historic wrongs of the slave trade, we add the tag “modern” to slavery, although of course we do not feel the need to call rape, as newly defined, “modern rape”, nor do we attempt to create a hierarchy of psychological pain within the experience.</p> <p>A huge cultural shift is still needed to recognise the phenomenon of modern slavery for what it is. The words we use matter because those who do not recognise it are, in effect, saying: we pay them enough for who they are. They may have to live on boats and hide, their status may be “illegal”, but their conditions are good enough for who they are. And who are they? They are poor, sometimes black or brown, and from elsewhere. Unchecked, such discrimination can lead to deep divisions based on race, as the Irish Equality and Human Rights Commission has pointed out.</p> <p>There are other reasons this story has made people feel queasy. It speaks of our hypocrisy about immigration. Generally we are against it, except where it provides a convenient pool of cheap labour, and then we allow ourselves to depend on it. We could grant migrant workers equal rights whatever their immigration status, as argued for by the organisations that have supported them bravely in Ireland for more than 15 years.</p> <p>But then they wouldn’t be cheap any more, and their purpose would be removed.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10966349","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405469","internalRevision":"47","internalContentCode":"458370195","publication":"The

relatives, they seemed a normal enough couple. Nathan Matthews held down a job as a takeaway delivery driver and was always good for a laugh and joke. Shauna Hoare was quiet but worked hard caring for Matthews’ ill mother. </p> <p>Behind the facade, however, Matthews and Hoare harboured disturbing sexual fantasies. They exchanged intimate messages about kidnapping petite girls. Their phones and computers were used to access pornography focused on teenagers, young women dressed as schoolgirls, and threesomes. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/11/becky-watts-stepbrother-nathan-matthews-guilty-murder\">Becky Watts murder: Nathan Matthews found guilty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the end, the pair were not content to watch their dark imaginings fulfilled on a screen. They turned one of their fantasies into reality when they persuaded a friend to join them in a threesome. Then in February Matthews went much, much further when he targeted his 16-year-old stepsister, Becky Watts, intending to use her – as the prosecution put it – as a “sexual plaything”. </p> <p>He went to her home equipped with a kidnap kit including stun-guns and handcuffs. Becky was suffocated in her bedroom and stabbed 15 times in the abdomen after her death. The pair then coolly took her body back to their home. They were calm enough to order a takeaway, play a game of Monopoly and next day laughed over a parody of the song Do You Want to Build a Snowman?, from the film Frozen, called Do You Want to Hide a Body? Together they set about dismembering Becky’s body with a circular saw, packed the remains in plastic and salt, and hid them in a garden shed. </p> <p> The pair will go down as one of the UK’s most notorious couples who have killed and, no doubt, will be mentioned by some alongside the likes of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, and Fred and Rose West. Their pasts will be pored over for clues to what turned them into killers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d2e10347811b76f028e392c9fd4752b2457d0e42\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d2e10347811b76f028e392c9fd4752b2457d0e42/4_192_1991_2985/667.jpg\" alt=\"Becky Watts\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Becky Watts was stabbed 15 times after her death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Matthews was brought up by his grandmother, Margaret May, and her husband, Christopher, in the village of Warmley in south Gloucestershire. As a teenager he spent hours alone in his bedroom, even taking his meals there. It was there he first became fascinated with pornography and by the time of Becky’s death was viewing sexual images almost every day. </p> <p> After school Matthews studied to be an electrician, but failed the course and became a delivery driver for Domino’s Pizza, for Sainsbury’s and a Chinese takeaway. </p> <p> From an early age he suffered from the rheumatic condition fibromyalgia, which left him often wracked with pain, depressed and anxious. A close friend said his illness made him feel “inadequate and useless”. Matthews admitted he had anger issues and described himself to police after his arrest as “emotionally unstable, psychologically disturbed ... a caveman.” </p> <p> His medical condition and fragile mental health did not stop him joining the Territorial Army. While a part-time soldier he learned survival and organisational skills that would come in useful when he disposed of Becky’s body. His “anger issues” meant he would never make a reliable soldier. He would snap – and colleagues recall their terror at the erratic way he drove an army vehicle when he was in a dark mood. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/11/becky-watts-shy-girl-growing-confidence\">Becky Watts: a shy girl who was growing in confidence</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Matthews did not have any sort of relationship with his father (the space for his name on the birth certificate is blank) but was reasonably close to his mother, factory worker Anjie. She met Darren Galsworthy and his two children – Becky and her older brother Daniel – a decade ago. Matthews got along with Darren and, at first, with Becky. When Darren and Anjie married, Matthews was best man. </p> <p> Hoare had a tough start in life. She was taken into care as a child before moving back in with her birth mother, Lisa Donovan, who has seven other children, when she was 13. Just a year or so later, she met and began a relationship with Matthews when she was just 14 or 15 and he was in his early 20s. Donovan was not impressed. She has described Matthews as flirty, sexually orientated and domineering. When Hoare asked him for anything he would ask for a “sexual favour” in return. </p> <p> Hoare moved out to a hostel owned by Bristol city council and, breaking the rules, Matthews began living there too. Hoare abruptly stopped seeing her mother after Matthews had a terrible row with her. He told Donovan she would never see her daughter again and the pair moved to a modern housing association terraced house in the Barton Hill area of Bristol, a couple of miles from where his mother, stepfather and Becky lived in St George. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b5006b73cf6c033e8edbeeab833d7ecb5cd8e58\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3b5006b73cf6c033e8edbeeab833d7ecb5cd8e58/0_136_1323_795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The couple caught on CCTV at a 99p Stores in Bristol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The couple were caught on CCTV entering a 99p Stores branch in Bristol, where they bought rubble sacks, duct tape and heavy duty sponge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Avon and Somerset police/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Matthews and Hoare began seeing more of the Galsworthys and Becky. Hoare became registered carer for Anjie, who has multiple sclerosis. And a strange love-hate relationship began with Becky. </p> <p> In interviews with police and in the witness box during their trial, Matthews and Hoare both claimed they disliked the way Becky treated Anjie and Darren, feeling she was self-centred and manipulated the couple. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He will jump out at her and she will scream and he finds it hilarious</p> <footer> <cite>Shauna Hoare on Nathan Matthews' teasing of Becky Watts</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Becky told a number of people she was scared of Matthews. Her best friend, Courtney Bicker, said Matthews had given his stepsister graphic details of how he would kill her, once suggesting he would batter her with a sledgehammer. Becky confided to a child psychologist she was frightened of Matthews. </p> <p> Matthews also appears to have become sexually fixated with Becky. The jury did not hear it but police discovered that when she was just eight – and Matthews was about 20 – she reported that he touched her leg through her clothing. In the months leading up to her murder, relatives noticed Matthews had begun a curious practice of leaping out at Becky to scare her. “He will jump out at her and she will scream and he finds it hilarious,” Hoare said. </p> <p> At home, Matthews was physically violent to Hoare. The most serious attack came when he pulled her by the hair on their bed and strangled her for four to five seconds. “I couldn’t breathe, I felt panic, I was scared,” Hoare said in the witness box. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bc4f4626828593249021bb21931e032d7e72a582\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/bc4f4626828593249021bb21931e032d7e72a582/281_306_1977_2962/667.jpg\" alt=\"Shauna Hoare during a police interview.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shauna Hoare during a police interview.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Avon and Somerset police/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Matthews also used psychological torment to control Hoare. He would accuse her of being fat – though she was always slim – and hated her smoking. She said she had to beg for food and pay him for cigarettes. “I feel like a child. He was my dad almost. He controlled every aspect of my life,” she said in court. He briefly allowed her to attend a further education college but stopped her going when he felt she was befriending other men.</p> <p>Some of those close to Matthews, however, also blame Hoare for the state of the relationship. His grandmother, Margaret, said she disapproved of Hoare and her grandson’s mental health declined during their relationship. He became paranoid she said, adding: “She was dominant in lots of ways.”<br /></p> <p> Certainly, Matthews appears to have been frightened of losing Hoare. In court he said he feared she would leave him. Once when she said she wanted to break up he used a fork to stab himself and violently scratch his own face. “He kind of went psycho,” Hoare said. That Matthews attempted to take the blame for Becky’s murder and the bloody aftermath and absolve Hoare of all responsibility shows either that he was extraordinarily loyal, or she had more control over him than both made out. The prosecution suggested it was the latter, comparing Hoare to Lady Macbeth and claiming she masterminded the cover-up following the killing. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/11/nathan-matthews-case-reignites-debate-over-violent-pornography\">Nathan Matthews case reignites debate over violent pornography</a> </p> </aside>  <p> At the time of Becky’s death, the pair were spending most of their time holed up in their cluttered, filthy house. They lived in the bedroom, with a toaster and kettle next to the bed so they did not have to get up to eat and drink. Hoare was pregnant. </p> <p>Detectives who investigated the case believe the bond that kept them together – and led to them to kill – was sex. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/shauna.phillips.399?fref=ts \">Hoare’s Facebook page</a> – under the surname Phillips, which she was also known by – is full of leery exchanges with Matthews. But the text messages about kidnapping and the pornography their devices accessed show it went much deeper than that. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bcu.ac.uk/social-sciences/about-us/staff/david-wilson\">David Wilson, professor of criminology at Birmingham City University,</a> who has followed the case, suggested the couple were gripped by a mental condition known as “folie à deux” – a madness shared by two people. A fantasy that developed from suggestive texts to an actual threesome – and ended with a sexually motivated attack.</p> <p> The case also has some similarities with another recent Bristol murder, that of the landscape architect Joanna Yeates, who was killed in a sexually motivated murder by her neighbour, Vincent Tabak. He, too, was a frequent user of hardcore pornography. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdbc3cd2dc4b51e10dadf7965d955f06c553d77a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/bdbc3cd2dc4b51e10dadf7965d955f06c553d77a/0_0_552_403/500.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the lounge at the couple's house\" width=\"500\" height=\"365\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of the lounge at the couple’s house in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Avon and Somerset police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://gaildines.com \">Gail Dines, professor of sociology and women’s studies at Wheelock College in Boston</a>, US, and a leading expert on pornography, said it was not possible to say categorically if an obsession with sexual images had led to Becky’s murder. But she pointed out that the use of “teen porn” was often a gateway to images of child sexual abuse – and to actual violence. </p> <p>Matthews has insisted he had no interest in Becky sexually and killed her when a plot to kidnap her and “teach her a lesson” for the way she treated his mother went wrong. Hoare maintained she knew nothing of the plot, the murder or the aftermath. The verdicts make it clear the jury thought their stories nonsense.</p> <p>

meth.</p> <p>The Smithsonian’s <a href=\"http://americanhistory.si.edu/\">National Museum of American History</a> in Washington hosted cast and crew of the TV drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\">Breaking Bad</a> on Tuesday, taking into custody more than 10 of its props “to recognise the show’s influence on American culture”.</p> <p>The series made a low-key start in 2008 but came to join the likes of The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men and House of Cards in the binge-viewing, box set pantheon, scooping numerous awards over five seasons. It followed the moral descent of White, played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/bryan-cranston\">Bryan Cranston</a>, a chemistry teacher who, after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, makes and deals in crystal methamphetamine to support his family.</p> <p>“Artifacts” donated to the museum include two yellow Tyvek suits and gas masks used by White and his former-student-turned-business partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) while cooking in their lab, and a small plastic bag of the “Blue Sky” meth they manufactured. There is also an ID card belonging to White’s brother-in-law Hank Schrader, a drugs law enforcement agent, and a paper cup from Los Pollos Hermanos, a fast food restaurant and front for money laundering in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the tale is set.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22bb7bbab3b01b2a8c092b4958f84357f4b1c023\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/22bb7bbab3b01b2a8c092b4958f84357f4b1c023/0_190_3296_1982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryan Cranston in the Heisenberg hat worn by his character, Walter White.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bryan Cranston in the Heisenberg hat worn by his character, Walter White.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patsy Lynch/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Tuesday’s informal and jocular handover ceremony, Cranston walked over to a table displaying the props and put on the black <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfdjBz8E_dw\">“Heisenberg hat” </a>– an alias borrowed from Werner Heisenberg, the scientist who formulated the uncertainty principle – he wore for much of the series.</p> <p>Amid laughter, wistful exclamations and rapid clicking of cameras, Cranston told the audience: “I wanted to see if it still fit. Thank you, everybody. Boy, it feels strange putting that back on.”</p> <p>He told fellow cast members he misses them but added: “I don’t miss the show, though. I’m asked often, do you miss playing this character, and the truth is, after really some reflection, that I don’t because Vince [<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/18/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-walter-white\">Gilligan, series creator</a>] and the writers created and crafted such a perfectly designed beginning, middle and end to this journey. People said incredulously, why wouldn’t you want to continue?</p> <p>“I said, it feels like we had a beautiful meal. We had an aperitif, a nice salad, a beautiful entree, a vegetable side, we had a great dessert and we had a coffee with it and you’re just satiated, and then someone says here’s more dessert. If you dived into that then it almost ruins the experience you had. I don’t know if my personage could take another dessert after the sweet ride that Breaking Bad was.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27e2410cf65646b59ccfffd4563ce274fe9d9f40\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/27e2410cf65646b59ccfffd4563ce274fe9d9f40/0_177_2992_1798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Norris, who played Hank Schrader, poses near some of the props.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Norris, who played Hank Schrader, poses near some of the props.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patsy Lynch/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later Cranston, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/09/bryan-cranston-scoops-tony-award-for-best-actor-in-broadway-debut\">who last year won a Tony award</a> for his Broadway debut playing president Lyndon B Johnson, toured a gallery devoted to American presidents and first ladies and was informed that Johnson used to drop in at the museum from the White House. The actor’s recent work also includes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/13/trumbo-review-bryan-cranston-toronto-tiff\">Trumbo</a>, a biopic in which he plays blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo.</p> <p>But it will be hard to repeat the runaway success of Breaking Bad which, having initially struggled to get studio backing, won awards including 16 Primetime Emmys and two Golden Globes. “I think the thing that really resonated was that Breaking Bad was a story of an average man who made decisions both good and bad, mostly bad,” Cranston told the Guardian. “People related to the sense of going from paycheque to paycheque and having desperate needs at home and the plight of teachers, the burnout sensation facing apathetic students every day. A man lost and depressed – it’s a very relatable thing – and how he makes a decision that turns out to be the worst in his life.</p> <p>“But if you asked Walter White if you regret making those decisions, I think he would be hard pressed to change his mind after two years of an exciting life or maybe three years of withering away and shrinking as a person. I think he didn’t want that, he wanted to go out more on his terms if that was possible, and I think that’s very relatable as well to people.”</p> <p>Cranston, 59, said he hoped the series would open the way for less conventional forms of narrative in the future. “I think it’s wide open. I think Breaking Bad showed the world that storytelling can be small or large, you can slow the pace down, people won’t just click off as the prevailing thought was. ‘If you’re not fast paced, they’re going to leave you,’ and they didn’t leave you. We were able to slow it down and that made the drama even more intense at times.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"055a38a63eba9b727f5c3b8458572a23caf269ba\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/055a38a63eba9b727f5c3b8458572a23caf269ba/0_0_3500_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yellow Tyvek suits are taken away after the memorabilia donation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yellow Tyvek suits are taken away after the memorabilia donation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Cameron/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gilligan, whose writing credits include The X-Files, used to visit the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum as a boy and admitted on Tuesday he felt he was dreaming. </p> <p>“I honestly thought Breaking Bad would never really get made. If you had told me in 2005 that props from our show would eventually find their way into the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, this same hallowed institution which houses the Star-Spangled Banner, Edison’s first lightbulb, Dorothy’s ruby slippers, Abraham Lincoln’s pocket watch, I would have thought you were using too much meth.”</p> <p>Currently overseeing the Breaking Bad spin-off <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/better-call-saul\">Better Call Saul</a>, which two weeks ago hosted fan Warren Buffett on set, Gilligan made clear that White has run his course but hinted that other characters from the fictional universe could return. “I almost feel like it would be bad form or bad karma to go back to that well, but having said that I don’t know, check with me in a few years. I don’t think there’s any more story to tell about Walter White necessarily, but maybe, who knows, some other characters who survive the series may have further that we might decide later that we wish to tell. But right now I really do feel like Brian, I feel like I’m satiated and it was time to push back from the dinner table, as it were.”</p> <p>The loss of both Breaking Bad and Mad Men <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/01/mad-mens-final-series-the-bittersweet-joy-of-saying-goodbye\">left some viewers bereft</a>. But Gilligan rejected the notion that the golden age of US television drama has passed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f4c974c98d693c412bde34ddd86f25437b5f7ec\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1f4c974c98d693c412bde34ddd86f25437b5f7ec/0_75_3500_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Heisenberg Hat is displayed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Heisenberg Hat is displayed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Cameron/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I think there are many more great shows to come and I will be very jealous when even more great ones come along and surpass ours but I think it’s all to the good,” he said. “I grew up watching three or four channels and now we live in a world of hundreds of channels and there needs to be content for all those channels. It’s this amazing democratising technology that allows in theory for a television show for everybody.”</p> <p>The National Museum of American History’s best known entertainment exhibit is probably <a href=\"http://www.artlyst.com/articles/ruby-slippers-go-on-view-at-londons-va-museum\">a pair of ruby slippers</a> worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz. Its growing television collection includes objects from Mad Men, The Wonder Years, Seinfeld and All in the Family. But these, along with the Breaking Bad items, are not likely to go on display until a culture gallery opens in 2018.</p> <p>Dwight Bowers, the museum’s curator, told the audience: “It gives me great pause to think I’m the man who brought crystal meth to the museum.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10970590","productionOffice":"US","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2404990","internalRevision":"292","internalContentCode":"458366253","publication":"The

Likewise, it is not Bolshevism to observe that extremes of inequality – whether measured by income or opportunity – have a corrosive effect on society. Clearly not, because those points were made on Tuesday in a thoughtful speech by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/11/john-major-blasts-shocking-inequality-levels-in-britain\" title=\"\">Sir John Major</a>, the former Conservative prime minister.</p> <p>That Sir John’s intervention made headlines testifies to a narrowing in recent years of Conservative discourse. It speaks to the party’s capture by a dogmatic view of the national economic interest predicated almost exclusively on the pursuit of budget discipline, whose social cost may be regretted but not cited as reason to change course.</p> <p>This view is underpinned by a deeper sense of historical purpose, harking back to Margaret Thatcher’s governments. This is the view that Tories are required by political destiny to enforce tough reforms, ferociously opposed yet later vindicated as necessary preparation for future prosperity. George Osborne sees criticism of his budgets almost as a re-enactment of reaction against Geoffrey Howe’s 1980s budgets – despised by Labour, denounced by economists and provoking queasiness among Tory “wets”, but ultimately redefining political consensus.</p> <p>The common caricature of Mr Osborne as a crude neo-Thatcherite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/11/bank-of-england-mark-carney-uk-unemployment-draghi-live\" title=\"\">is unfair</a>. In reality, he has a nuanced view of the role of the state, embodied in his pet “northern powerhouse” project, his business levy to fund apprenticeships and his support for investment in infrastructure. But those ambitions are overshadowed by the implications of his fiscal policy. He himself may imagine his project as a healthy rebalancing from state subsidy of incomes (cutting benefits) to state sponsorship of wealth creation (a new industrial strategy). But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/nov/11/john-major-and-gordon-brown-defend-benefit-claimants-politics-live\" title=\"\">as Gordon Brown argued</a> on Wednesday, his record will be defined by the scale and pace of cuts, and the suffering they inflict.</p> <p>Sir John’s warning over inequality is not the first in-house Tory sign that Mr Osborne has over-reached. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/11/fresh-blow-george-osborne-planned-tax-credit-cuts-reforms\" title=\"\">Tory MPs</a> and newspapers normally quick to defend the chancellor have complained that cuts to tax credits punish hard work and aspiration – emblematic virtues in the Conservative creed. The House of Lords has forced Mr Osborne to revisit the policy. A similar backlash looks inevitable when the next round of cuts hits local government budgets, forcing the closure of services and, most cruelly, a crisis in social care funding. The immiseration of vulnerable elderly people will be politically, not to mention morally, intolerable.</p> <p>Mr Osborne has more room for manoeuvre than appears to be the case. The budget straitjacket he wears was donned as a matter of political choice, not economic necessity. He aims for a surplus of £10bn by the end of the parliament – a figure already downgraded from £23bn envisaged in his 2014 autumn statement. His credentials as a fiscal disciplinarian are not doubted by friend, foe or bond market. For most analysts, productivity, skills and wages are the weaknesses in Britain’s economy in greatest need of attention.</p> <p>Further helping the chancellor is an opposition leadership with little interest in restoring Labour’s credentials as a party sensitive to public concerns about its attitude to borrowing and spending. Mr Osborne could steer a softer path towards balanced books confident that John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, would gain little from the climbdown. Mr McDonnell is notionally committed to reducing the deficit. But in the polarised climate of British politics today, much of the left does not recognise the existence of “moderate austerity”, which leaves that option wide open to Mr Osborne. He has abandoned budget targets once already, in 2012, with relative impunity.</p> <p>Mr Osborne has no choice but to soften the blow of tax credit cuts when he delivers his spending review later this month. He is shrewd enough to devise some mechanism that appears to compensate the worst affected, while burying in small print the bad news for whoever picks up the bill. He will have to resort to craft of that nature if the whole package is to remain true to the established fiscal framework. But the chancellor’s surplus target should be more negotiable than that. His reputation as an advocate of austerity is invulnerable. For the sake of political expediency, he can afford to amend the plan in the name of compassion. And tens of thousands of people in Britain cannot afford to pay for the plan as it stands.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10969754","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405590","internalRevision":"28","internalContentCode":"458371251","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> The chancellor should pay heed to his predecessors at the Treasury – and to the doubts of his own MPs","allowUgc":"false","headline":"The Guardian view on austerity strategy: time for George Osborne to be flexible","byline":"Editorial","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T20:04:26Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/11/1447267855419/John-Major-001.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56438cfce4b05f01ec0a2dbe","newspaperPageNumber":"42","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-14T20:04:26Z","standfirst":"The chancellor should pay heed to his predecessors at the Treasury – and to the doubts of his own MPs<br />","creationDate":"2015-11-11T18:46:20Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T22:01:12.001Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/11/the-guardian-view-on-austerity-strategy-time-for-george-osborne-to-be-flexible","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/11/the-guardian-view-on-austerity-strategy-time-for-george-osborne-to-be-flexible","sectionName":"Comment is free","elements":[{"id":"8a588f66ee10b5f240f09e027d013326c5af9fdf","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/11/1447267861361/John-Major-005.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*31444493","altText":"John Major","caption":"Former prime minister John Major, whose intervention ‘speaks to the party’s capture by a dogmatic view of the national economic interest predicated almost exclusively on the pursuit of budget discipline’.

Regulators tend to welcome onlookers when they think they are doing a fine job and, sure enough, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/more-city-reforms-needed-bank-of-england-governor-tells-forum\">governor, Mark Carney, set the tone</a> by declaring the age of “heads I win; tails you lose capitalism” is coming to an end.</p> <p>Up to a point, the boast is reasonable. There is greater confidence that taxpayers would not be on the hook in a repeat of a 2007-08-style banking crisis. Capital cushions are plumper; ringfencing rules and banks’ so-called living wills should make bondholders bear pain before the bill lands on the public purse.</p> <p>The system has yet to be tested under fire – the only true measure – and bankers grumble that the search for resilience has created a new danger by removing liquidity from markets. But the new regime is plainly an improvement on the past; it could hardly be worse.</p> <p>As for personal accountability in banking – well, the jury is out. It is alarming that the banking lobby has succeeded in watering down rules that would have obliged senior managers to prove they had acted responsibly. Parliament backed the idea after long debate; the industry screamed with fury and is getting its way.</p> <p>But here’s the bigger complaint: whatever happened to the idea that strong financial markets require greater competition, not just better regulation? In the (understandable) desire to squash outrageous abuses such as the rigging of Libor and foreign exchange markets, the pro-competition agenda seems to have been shelved.</p> <p>In the City, the princely fees charged by investment banks in rights issues and fundraisings continue to look like legalised extortion at the expense of clients and investors. On the high street, the Competition and Markets Authority delivered a report of astonishing timidity that would reinforce the current oligopoly – even hardened cynics were shocked. If we have to wait for new technology (trumpeted in George Osborne’s contribution) to improve matters, the race will be long.</p> <p>The charge, then, against the regulators and politicians is this: the technocratic fixes – the stress-tests, the capital requirements, the ringfencing regime – are being executed well. But effective markets should also be competitive, and it’s hard to say we are even close to that in the financial world. Instead, there seems to be a new form of regulatory capture – a quiet agreement that greater resilience has been hard to secure so nobody will shout too loudly about the benefits to consumers of harder competition.</p> <p>In other words, it’s good news that Carney’s coin is less weighted than it was, but the odds still favour the old order.</p> <h2>TalkTalk hopes to emulate Nike’s bounce</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"650aed8f0f0e523c46a1a600986f5daff32ca56d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/650aed8f0f0e523c46a1a600986f5daff32ca56d/185_0_3204_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"TalkTalk has made an admirable attempt to boost its reputation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TalkTalk has made an admirable attempt to boost its reputation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>TalkTalk made an eye-catching claim in its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/talktalk-raises-dividend-cyber-attack-costs-revealed\">post-cyber attack half-year figures</a>. It said protecting customers’ data better, and rewarding loyalty, “will, in time, more than mitigate any lasting impact of the attack”.</p> <p>More than mitigate? Really? Every threat is an opportunity, they say, but is chief executive Lady Harding suggesting that TalkTalk will be a net winner eventually? Yes, something like that. She argues that customers whose complaints are dealt with satisfactorily are more loyal. She offers Nike, once under fire for use of sweatshops, as a brand that responded to a crisis and emerged stronger, as TalkTalk hopes to do.</p> <p>TalkTalk is not Nike, however, so let’s see if life runs so happily. Its recent history has been an admirable attempt by Harding over many years to shed a reputation for lousy customer service. It’s impossible to know how much good work has been undone. The £35m upfront cost is manageable, and giving all customers freebie upgrades is sensible, but the damage to the brand will emerge only when contracts expire – just the 4% of customers directly affected were allowed to cancel early.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Harding is sticking to her medium-term financial targets but insists it is “too early to say” whether the promised 25% profit margin will arrive on schedule in the next financial year. That’s a cop-out, but a wise one.</p> <h2>Is boredom eating into supermarket profits?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe17a0fb9cb487e41f95e11d1fb69734a024d7bb\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/fe17a0fb9cb487e41f95e11d1fb69734a024d7bb/0_233_3492_2095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sainsbury’s profits slump was better than feared.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sainsbury’s profits slump was better than feared.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/sainsburys-profits-slide-amid-supermarket-price-war\">Sainsbury’s 18% fall in half-year profits</a> counts as a half-decent result for a supermarket chain these days. The old problems we know about – commodity deflation, discounters, internet shopping, etcetera. But the retailer’s chief executive, Mike Coupe, put his finger on another. In a reversal of 30 years of post-recessionary trends, grocery sales have not risen when disposable incomes have improved. Spare cash is going instead on eating out, clothes and holidays. We’re bored of supermarkets, as Coupe didn’t put it, obviously.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971687","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405577","internalRevision":"438","internalContentCode":"458371184","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Effective markets should also be competitive, and it’s hard to say we are even close to that in the financial world.

to be publicly flogged in Saudi Arabia for alcohol possession, says he is looking forward to rebuilding his life after returning to the UK.</p> <p>The 74-year-old flew back on Tuesday to be reunited with his family, who had launched a campaign for his release on compassionate grounds as his wife Verity is dying of Alzheimer’s and is in Britain receiving care.</p> <p>“I am truly humbled and will never forget the love and support of so many people in getting me home,” he told ITV News. <br /></p> <p>In an interview with the Sun, he said his supporters had “saved my life” and added: “I am overwhelmed by the support and am grateful to prime minister David Cameron and the government for stepping in.” </p> <p>News of his release was announced by the Foreign Office. </p> <p>“Karl Andree was released from prison hours after my visit to Riyadh on 28 October,” Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, said in a statement on Wednesday. “I’m pleased that he has returned home to be reunited with his family, bringing to an end an extremely tough time for him and his family.”</p> <p>Andree, 74, had been in jail since his arrest in Jeddah in August 2014 after bottles of home-brewed wine were reportedly found in his car. He was sentenced to 350 lashes.</p> <p>Cameron intervened personally after the family went public with his case. Andree’s children had pressed the prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/karl-andree-briton-350-lashes-saudi-arabia-david-cameron\">to do more to help their father</a>, an oil executive who had suffered from cancer. After his release was announced last month, his family attributed Saudi Arabia’s decision to relent to intense media publicity in Britain.</p> <p>In his statement, Hammond said the outcome was testimony to the strength of the UK’s relations with Riyadh.</p> <p>“I’m grateful to the Saudi Arabian government for their efforts in ensuring this positive outcome, following our discussions during my visit. It’s through the strength and breadth of the relationship between our nations that we have been able to overcome a difficult issue like this.”</p> <p>The Andree case came as relations between the UK and Saudi Arabia were going through a rocky patch after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/uk-ditches-plan-to-bid-for-saudi-arabia-prisons-contract\">UK cancelled a contract to provide training to its prisons</a>. Michael Gove, the justice secretary, gave no reason for the decision, but there has been a campaign against the programme focusing on Saudi Arabia’s record on human rights.</p> <p>Andree, who has seven grandchildren, worked as an oil executive in Saudi Arabia for 25 years and has had cancer three times. More than 230,000 people signed an online petition calling for the prime minister to intervene to stop Andree from receiving the lashings. </p> <p>His family has said he would undergo immediate tests for cancer when he returned to the UK.<br /></p> <p>Simon Andree, his son, said: “First of all he needs to check to see what state his cancer is in – whether he’s still in remission or whether anything else has happened – so that will be one of the first things to happen.”</p> <p>Three of his grandchildren, Lucy, 12, Celia, 10, and Edward, nine, also appealed to Cameron in a video message, in which they said their grandfather was a “really old man” and “no human deserves to be treated like this”. </p> <p>Human rights groups have welcomed Andree’s release but have called on the UK to push Saudi Arabia harder on cases such as that of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/11/saudi-blogger-raif-badawi-next-lashes-friday\">blogger Raif Badawi</a>, whose flogging for insulting Islam is due to resume soon, according to his wife, despite him reportedly nearly dying after receiving the first 50 lashes.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10972131","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405111","internalRevision":"429","internalContentCode":"458367214","publication":"The

He sets out the financial facts behind the current problems facing many hospitals in the NHS, and describes the inevitable consequences to clinical services and their patients if the government continues with its current approach. I come at this debate from two perspectives: as a retired hospital CEO and as a patient of St George’s Hospital over the last year.</p> <p>I know that the NHS has faced financial challenges on previous occasions and has for many years found a series of efficiency savings. However, as Smallwood points out, efficiency savings are not a bottomless pit. High quality and safe patient services (apparently a government objective), which I have personally experienced at St George’s, cannot be delivered with inadequate funding. Nor can they be delivered well when the financial bottom line becomes organisationally the over-riding priority.</p> <p>Many reports on “inadequate” services in the NHS, including those from the Care Quality Commission, focus on a lack of leadership, rather than lack of funding, as the root cause of the problems encountered. Smallwood is spelling out to the government that they need a major rethink of the NHS funding settlement. Let’s hope they listen and act.<br /><strong>Mary Wells</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>• As a fellow chair of an NHS foundation trust in Cumbria I fully support all the points made by Christopher Smallwood, chair of St George’s Trust. I have been making similar points for the last three months (in a personal capacity) with particular emphasis on two things:</p> <p>1) We were never consulted about the viability of making £22bn efficiency/productivity savings by 2020. Had we been then I for one would have argued that there is no known evidence from any sector – private, public or third, and I have worked in all three – of this level of savings being achieved by these means. In the private sector, in my experience, if a product or service cannot pay its way then the company will generally withdraw from providing it. This leads to the second point:</p> <p>2) If insufficient money is to be made available for the ever increasing demands made on the NHS, as so clearly identified by Smallwood, then there needs to be a national political debate about what that actually means for the NHS. Are we expected to reduce staffing (which, of course, is the biggest single element of expenditure) thereby compromising quality of service delivery? Or are we expected to make local decisions about which services we can no longer afford to deliver? While this national debate is not taking place, and the consequences of funding decisions are being ignored, individual trusts are struggling, but increasingly failing, to meet the demands of their regulators to achieve savings that everyone knows are impossible. Soon individual trusts may well feel unable to resist suspending some services as no longer affordable – and we can all imagine the local outcry that would generate.<br /><strong>Mike Taylor</strong><br /><em>Clifton, Cumbria</em></p> <p>• Speaking out about the NHS financial situation is welcome but it does not tell the whole story, which is not just about the money. The stress on clinical staff is huge; shortages of key members of the team, high levels of demand and proposed contract changes are driving many to question their vocation and even to take strike action. Workforce planning failures are coming home to roost in hospitals, mental health and primary care. This is not just a financial crisis – the survival of the NHS as we know it is at stake.</p> <p>My trust is fast running out of cash and is reliant on forward payments from our commissioners. We are also running out of the precious commodity of staff in key specialities. Christopher Smallwood’s call for us to speak truth to power may be too late.<br /><strong>Dr Mike Williams</strong><br /><em>Non-executive director, Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust</em></p> <p>• I read Christopher Smallwood’s piece with interest. I too have been a chairman of a big NHS hospital trust, for some 12 years, and I understand the pressures his trust is facing as well as anyone. There is an easy solution: throw more money at it. But at best, that can only be a part of the answer. If it is the whole answer, we will continue to pour public money into the health service at an unsustainable rate and – worse than that – will continue to treat many patients in the wrong place: the acute hospital.</p> <p>The right answer is more difficult: it is a combination of reducing clinical and operating variation in our hospitals, thereby improving quality and reducing waste; joining up care across all settings, particularly for those people who have long-term chronic conditions, who would be better treated out of hospital; and taking prevention seriously, especially the growing scourge of obesity.</p> <p>The government has committed extra spending of at least £10bn a year by 2020-21. It can do this because the economy is growing and the deficit is falling. It is backing the NHS’s own five-year plan. It is the right plan and as minister for NHS productivity I am proud to do so too.<br /><strong>David Prior</strong><br /><em>Parliamentary under-secretary of state for health </em></p> <p>• I have recently completed six years as a public governor of one of the largest NHS foundation trusts in the country, the last two as lead governor. I am daily filled with admiration at the heroics performed by all the staff of the trust, from chairman, chief executive and managers, down to the lowest paid ancillary, to provide the highest quality of medical care possible. Yet they do this with one hand tied behind their backs, and to make any one part of the whole perform at 100% efficiency means moving resources from somewhere else. The budget has been cut to the bone and capital projects postponed, even those that are vital to cope with ever increasing demand. We are all potential patients, rich and poor alike, and to starve the NHS in the way that this government is doing will ultimately have a negative impact on the health of the population as a whole.<br /><strong>Dr Keith Paver</strong><br /><em>Manchester</em></p> <p>• The Guardian has followed in the footsteps of the Financial Times which a few weeks ago stated that the government would be funding the NHS to the tune of £8bn per year during this parliament. Simon Stevens, head of the NHS, is quoted in different Guardian articles as stating that the funding during this parliament will be £8bn per year and £8bn in total.</p> <p>My understanding of Stevens’ Forward View document, published earlier this year, is that £30bn is the minimum needed to see the NHS through. £8bn per year would be just fine but is unfortunately a fanciful figure.</p> <p>Christopher Smallwood’s account of NHS finances is a concise and erudite account of the crisis in the NHS, and I hope that more staff, patients and board members will express their dismay about government policy which is wrecking the NHS.</p> <p>As a governor in a large NHS trust, I hope that other governors will campaign against the current funding arrangements in the run-up to the autumn statement. Most of us are elected and have a mandate to ensure that patient care is safe and of high quality.<br /><strong>Dr Veronica Beechey</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>• What I could not find in Christopher Smallwood’s article is any reference to the “efficiency savings” that have been imposed on the NHS, which I assume is a euphemism for cuts, or to Mr Cameron’s pre-election promise to ringfence NHS budgets. This whole scenario reminds me of the run up to the privatisation of British Rail which at the time was being starved of public funding and accused of being inefficient. Private enterprise took over, wangled an even bigger subsidy out of the government and paid shareholders out of the proceeds.</p> <p>The next stage therefore as far as health is concerned, is for the government to declare that people should take out health insurance (a profitable business), private companies will run our hospitals (for profit) and GPs will charge for their services. The government then washes its hands of taking any responsibility for public health, and we adopt the American system which is the most expensive health provision in the world which makes a handsome profit for those businesses involved, and neglects to cater for the poorer members of our society. What a great reduction in the welfare budget!</p> <p>Already I notice an increase in TV adverts offering an opportunity to jump the NHS queues if you take out health insurance. Surely none of these companies are Tory party donors.<br /><strong>David Selby</strong><br /><em>South Wonston, Hampshire</em></p> <p>• Thank goodness that a senior experienced manager has at last spoken out about the funding crisis in the NHS. It is not surprising that hospitals are running a deficit as the tariff has been cut and they are not fully reimbursed for emergency work over target, a situation over which they have no control, despite which they are fined for not meeting targets. Staff cuts in order to balance the budget lead to demoralised staff which in turn increases sickness absence and increases use of more expensive agency staff. Mr Smallwood suggests that ministers are in denial but there is an alternative explanation, which is that this government is deliberately underfunding the NHS to drive it into failure. Over the last three financial years the NHS has retuned £7.5bn to the Treasury, £3.2bn in the last year which if used correctly by the NHS to pay hospitals for the work they have done would have prevented so may of them going into deficit.

The other companies under investigation did not respond to requests for comment. </p> <p>Extra virgin is the highest quality olive oil, and consequently the most expensive. It comes from the first press of healthy olives, and has a maximum acidity of 0.8%. Virgin olive oil, which is hard to find in a supermarket, is of a slightly lower quality, with a more acidic flavour, while plain olive oil is refined and often treated with chemicals and deodorised to mask the taste of rancid, spoilt oil.</p> <p>It is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/13/extra-virginity-tom-mueller-review\">not the first time that Italian olive oil has come under scrutiny</a>. In 2012, Italian investigators looked into claims that some of the largest producers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jan/04/olive-oil-food-fraud\">had adulterated domestic oil</a> with less expensive imports from Spain, Greece, Morocco and Tunisia. There was also a case in which a major olive oil dealer, Domenico Ribatti, was jailed for trying to pass off Turkish hazelnut oil as olive oil.</p> <p>The business of trying to pass off adulterated or misbranded oil and calling it “extra virgin” was chronicled in depth by the author Tom Mueller, who in his 2011 book, <a href=\"http://www.truthinoliveoil.com/about-truth-olive-oil\">Extra Virginity</a>, described how the product that is seen as key to healthy living and the Mediterranean diet, has long been a favourite object of fraudsters who take advantage of consumers’ ignorance about what extra virgin olive oil ought to taste like. </p> <p>“Olives are stone fruits, so extra virgin olive oil is like fresh squeezed fruit juice. It should be fruity, pungent, and bitter. Those are the indications of freshness, quality and health,” Mueller said.</p> <p>The investigation unveiled this week, he added, reminded him of an old Italian expression: it was as if investigators had discovered hot water. “Anyone who knows anything about the industry knows there is a lot of this going on,” he alleged.</p> <p>At the centre of the problem lies the immense market power of the sellers and the inaction of the Italian ministry of agriculture, Mueller said, despite allegations of problems in the industry that have made news for a decade or more. </p> <p>The issue is a difficult one for consumers to navigate. Extra virgin olive oil is a major component of a healthy Mediterranean diet, and <a href=\"http://www.truthinoliveoil.com/great-oil/how-to-buy-great-olive-oil\">Mueller has a few tips for consumers</a>, including looking for bottles with a best by date to ensure freshness.</p> <p>He also recommends that consumers seek out a precise point of production on the label (not just an Italian flag) when they are buying extra virgin olive oil, and that they try to visit a vendor that performs stringent quality control on the oils it sells. </p> <p>Also, choosing bottled oil that is sold in a dark glass in a quantity that you will quickly use is a good indicator, since high-quality oil can rapidly go bad after it is opened and stored in a hot or bright

Then, half of Muslims said they had not witnessed Islamophobia – a figure that has now crashed to 18%.</p> <p>Furthermore, feelings of being increasingly demonised and discriminated against are rising, according to the report, which says Muslims suffer physical and verbal abuse, as well as discrimination in the workplace.</p> <p>The study is based on interviews with 1,780 people and repeats questions asked in 2010.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/muslim-leaders-in-uk-warn-of-worrying-levels-of-islamophobia\">Muslim leaders in UK warn of 'worrying' levels of Islamophobia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the latest study, nearly every headline finding is worse. The results paint a picture of alienation among a community seen by Whitehall, police and security officials as crucial to helping provide intelligence to thwart terrorism.</p> <p>More than two-thirds of Muslims told the survey they had heard anti-Islamic comments by politicians, and half thought politicians condoned Islamophobic acts. Nearly nine out of 10 thought discrimination was driven by the way Muslims are portrayed in media coverage.</p> <p>The findings come amid controversy about a planned crackdown on what the government says are extreme views, which are currently lawful, which some British Muslims and even police chiefs warn will create further alienation.</p> <p>Subtle effects of discrimination are also on the rise, the study claims. It found 63% said they had experienced “being talked down to or treated as if you were stupid; having your opinions minimised or devalued”, up from 38% in 2010.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af4aced581ac13192ce4822dc3bbfa25b1986827\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/af4aced581ac13192ce4822dc3bbfa25b1986827/0_0_2046_1227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Video footage shows Simone Joseph shouting abuse at Muslim women on a London bus in October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Video shows Simone Joseph abusing Muslim women on a London bus in October.

This perception indicates that the level of political discourse is seen to be poisonous and one of attribution of blame to Muslims.”</p> <p>Since 2001 the government has been trying to counter a rising terrorist threat, and it says the threat of attack by those driven by an extremist Islamist ideology is high. </p> <p>The IHRC was criticised by the Henry Jackson Society (HJS) thinktank. “The group argues that government policy is designed to criminalise Islam and Muslims, when in fact the recent counter-extremism strategy rightly promises to address the growing levels of anti-Muslim hate crime in the UK,” a spokesperson said. “The IHRC’s claims fuel additional and unnecessary fear within Muslim communities, which we believe is far more divisive than any efforts to identify and challenge extremism and radicalisation.”</p> <p>The commission responded to the comments by saying the HJS follows a neoconservative agenda. The HJS denies this and says it has all-party support for its work promoting liberal democracy. </p> <p>Others welcomed the report. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, said: “This will make very uncomfortable reading; not all will agree with every aspect of the analysis, but it is painfully clear that physical and verbal violence against Muslims has risen spectacularly in recent years. What is described here is a serious reproach to our society’s most humane ideals and values.”</p> <p>Prof Ian Law, of the University of Leeds, said the study shed light on the rise of anti-Muslim prejudice: “This report identifies a shocking deterioration in the quality of everyday life since the last report in 2011. Increasing hostility in political and media discourse, increasing hostility on the streets in terms of physical attacks and abuse and increasing hostility in the labour market and in educational contexts are some of the key markers of increasing anti-Muslim hate identified here.”</p> <p>The findings match what some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/19/government-extremism-crackdown-hurt-uk-values-peter-fahy-manchester]\">senior police chiefs have told the Guardian</a> about their assessment of Muslims communities.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10970592","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405094","internalRevision":"730","internalContentCode":"458367046","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"60% of respondents to survey say they have seen abuse or discrimination directed at fellow Muslims, up from 40% in 2010","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Majority of British Muslims have witnessed Islamophobia – study","byline":"Vikram Dodd","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T12:05:51Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/6c8bf54c6fc302fae305b6faf312aa8a792ad402/0_0_3504_2101/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5643166ce4b0ddf11c1fbf6f","newspaperPageNumber":"18","standfirst":"<p>60% of respondents to survey say they have seen abuse or discrimination directed at fellow Muslims, up from 40% in 2010</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T10:20:28Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T22:01:06.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/majority-of-british-muslims-have-witnessed-islamophobia-study","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/nov/11/majority-of-british-muslims-have-witnessed-islamophobia-study","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"6c8bf54c6fc302fae305b6faf312aa8a792ad402","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/6c8bf54c6fc302fae305b6faf312aa8a792ad402/0_0_3504_2101/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"2005 AFP","picdarUrn":"GD*9901480","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/6c8bf54c6fc302fae305b6faf312aa8a792ad402","suppliersReference":"Par269879","altText":"Worshippers during Friday prayer at the East London Mosque.","caption":"Worshippers during Friday prayer at the East London Mosque.

published work, we show that the coral reefs of the Egyptian Sinai are the most valuable in the world, generating fine sand beaches, calm water and fabulous opportunities for world-class snorkelling and diving, all within a short flight from Europe.</p> <p>The tragedy of recent events (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/10/syria-world-putin-bombing-russian-jet\" title=\"\">Report, 11 November</a>) is complex and manifold. Of course there is the loss of innocent life. And there is also the loss of critical foreign exchange to Egypt, and of employment and income locally.</p> <p>But there is also a loss of access to a beautiful, special place, enjoyed by millions. Tourism can be pretty damaging to coral reefs, but being ignored and unmanaged, can sometimes bring a host of other threats. And we have no idea how to quantify the loss of experience.</p> <p>How many of the Sinai’s visitors became ambassadors, caring at once for nature and the many benefits it brings? How important are the views held in the rich west important in shifting concerns about climate change, the extinction crisis, and the livelihoods of coral reef-dependent populations worldwide?<br

The rebels say the opposite is the case.</p> <p>Russia has been calling on moderate opposition forces in Syria to agree a truce with the government and fight with it against the common terrorist threat. But Khoja and three of his predecessors as SNC president argue that Assad has to go if there is to be an effective strategy for fighting Isis.<br /></p> <p>“The only way to create the ground forces capable of fighting terror and stabilising the country is by formulating a political plan that ensures a genuine transition away from the current leadership of the regime and stating clearly that the end game is Assad’s exit from power,” they said.</p> <p>The UN’s Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura, wants to launch a political process between the Syrian government and “a united delegation of opposition groups” on the basis of the June 2012 Geneva agreement, which called for the formation of a transitional government in Damascus. <br /></p> <p>The SNC says it will not take part in talks in Moscow but the Russians hope to convince other opposition groups broadly loyal to Assad to attend.</p> <p>Mistura has urged world powers to build on the momentum of new international talks to help devise a roadmap to end the war.

He told reporters he was pleased to be back in the West Bank but added: “It seems as though there’s some anxiety about some meetings – they’re worried about some of the safety aspects. </p> <p>“There’s some stuff going on on social media apparently, so rather depressingly we can’t do the youth forum and one other meeting.” </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78a9f88fd36dd0c32b934a0fd8abfb5fc8f42fb6\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/78a9f88fd36dd0c32b934a0fd8abfb5fc8f42fb6/0_91_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson has a coffee with Ziad al-Bandak, an adviser to the Palestinian president\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson has a coffee with Ziad al-Bandak, an adviser to the Palestinian president, during a tour of Jerusalem’s Old City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reporters were later informed that Palestine Women’s Business Forum meeting also off. Asked about the security threat, Johnson said: “The reality is we were determined to come here even though it’s quite a difficult time at the moment and there’s a lot of tension. </p> <p>“I think that some people have obviously taken remarks I made about the boycott – which is, after all, British government policy – they’ve taken offence of that and that’s been very much whipped up on social media. So we had a message from the office of the prime minister that the security with us was going to be perhaps at risk and so we’ve had to think about those meetings.” </p> <p>Johnson said he hoped they would go ahead but the current situation was that they would not. He went on: “If it’s true people are making threats or whatever, that’s very sad.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/eu-sets-guidelines-on-labelling-products-from-israeli-settlements\">EU issues guidelines on labelling products from Israeli settlements</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An upsurge in violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the last month has claimed 90 lives, including Palestinians involved in attacks on Jews.</p> <p>Other remarks made by Johnson during his visit combined his usual flippancy with hyperbolic enthusiasm for Israel and patronising comments about “Arabs”, not least in his inaugural Winston Churchill speech in Jerusalem.</p> <p>He said in the speech: “If we look at the history of modern Israel there is no doubt that the comparison can be extended, and that there is something Churchillian about the country he helped to create. There is the audacity, the bravery, the willingness to take risks with feats of outrageous derring-do.”</p> <p>He added: “When [Churchill] wrote his 1922 white paper that paved the way for accelerated Jewish entry into Palestine, Churchill imagined Jews and Arabs living side by side, with technically expert Jewish farmers helping the Arabs to drive tractors.”<br

The latest market share figures from Kantar show Aldi and Lidl sales are up 17.6% and 17.9% respectively year on year. The next best performing grocer is Iceland, which grew by 3.2%.</p> <p>It took Aldi and Lidl 20 years to understand the UK market, but now they have reset the expectations for what customers should pay for groceries. There are likely to be bumps in the road for the discount retailers as some stores become overcrowded and some shoppers are turned off by the limited assortment of goods on offer in Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>However, purely on the basis that Aldi and Lidl plan to double the number of stores they have in the UK while the big four – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – halt new openings, it is easy to conclude the revolution they have sparked in grocery shopping has barely begun. In the next five years they are likely to double their share of grocery spending in the UK to 15%.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b093dbaf0564a0f5eeaec73b65874658c30896ab\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b093dbaf0564a0f5eeaec73b65874658c30896ab/0_0_3091_1854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marks &amp; Spencer’s food division has gone from strength to strength.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marks &amp; Spencer’s food division has gone from strength to strength.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/04/marks-spencer-fashion-and-homes-sales-fall\">The 132-year-old chain has struggled to grow clothing sales</a>, but its food business is thriving, with sales rising by 3.3% in the past six months.</p> <p>The basic explanation for the success of Marks &amp; Spencer’s food division is that shoppers are combining cut-price purchases from the discounters with treats from M&amp;S. The vast majority of products sold in M&amp;S are own-brand, meaning it is not as vulnerable to a price war as the big four – and one in five of its products is a new item. </p> <p>The company, which has successfully established a distinctive upmarket position in the sector, is also benefiting from the growth of convenience shopping and households not buying their food for dinner until that day. M&amp;S has almost 550 Simply Food shops, many at train stations, which are popular lunch destinations for office workers but also a place to pick up food on the way home for work.</p> <p>As ever, expect M&amp;S Food to enjoy Christmas. The retailer will provide a quarter of the turkeys eaten on Christmas Day – an extraordinary proportion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/supermarket_share-zip/giv-31114Joq0FRG6QTaS/\" data-alt=\"UK market share, 12 weeks to 11 October 2015\"> <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/supermarket_share-zip/giv-31114Joq0FRG6QTaS/\">UK market share, 12 weeks to 11 October 2015</a> <figcaption>UK market share, 12 weeks to 11 October 2015</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/waitrose\">Waitrose</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"199078fa65f3e6f9a45fbe9ab12b51da21594e13\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/199078fa65f3e6f9a45fbe9ab12b51da21594e13/0_0_3936_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waitrose is still growing profits despite a dip in sales in stores open for more than a year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waitrose is still growing profits despite a dip in sales in stores open for more than a year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The upmarket grocer, part of the John Lewis Partnership, has suffered a decline in sales in stores open for more than a year in 2015, while its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/20/waitrose-boss-mark-price-quits\">boss, Mark Price, has announced he will leave early next year</a>.</p> <p>However, the retailer is still growing profits and has become the most innovative in the market.

The company’s pre-tax profits of £339m are way ahead of rivals Tesco and Morrisons, and far better than the £290m loss it reported this time last year when Sainsbury’s wrote off the value of underperforming supermarkets.</p> <p>Sainsbury’s is well-placed for the Christmas season. It traditionally gains market share in holiday seasons owing to the strong reputation of its fresh food. But it is likely to be boosted further this year because in the period before last Christmas it reduced prices and angered customers by cutting the points they were awarded on their Nectar reward cards. This means Sainsbury’s will be comparing its sales against a weaker period last year, and its like-for-like sales figure should benefit as a result.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/asda\">Asda</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"779e49ba7db55588a216080f36409f9733a8a58f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/779e49ba7db55588a216080f36409f9733a8a58f/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers gather outside the Asda store in Wembley, north-west London, on Black Friday last year.

The retailer is scaling back such promotions this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Parry/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The budget retailer has made headlines for drastically scaling back its participation in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/black-friday\">Black Friday</a>. It said this was in response to feedback from customers, many of whom would prefer Asda cut the price of food and drink rather than offer one-off discounts on electrical items.</p> <p>However, cynics say it is an attempt by Asda and its US parent company, Walmart, to protect the supermarket’s profits. Asda reported a 4.7% fall in sales at established stores in the three months to 30 June, the worst performance in its 50-year history, amid fierce competition from the discounters and its rivals slashing prices and issuing millions of discount vouchers.</p> <p>It is unclear how much this performance is due to Asda genuinely struggling or Walmart, the biggest retailer in the world, demanding that the retailer protects its profits rather than get dragged into a price war. </p> <p>Asda was the first of the big four to recognise the rise of Aldi and Lidl and launch a fightback. In late 2013, it committed £1bn to cutting prices and revamping shops over the next five years. However, in a sign that Asda is concerned about its performance, last month it overhauled that five-year plan, announcing it would make further price cuts, accelerate improvements to its largest shops, delay the opening of new smaller shops in London and scrap plans to build more click and collect sites for online orders.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons\">Morrisons</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44a0dc968b649edae56ccf6650c1c417a2a974d1\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/44a0dc968b649edae56ccf6650c1c417a2a974d1/0_255_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrisons’ new chief plans to tailor the products in each supermarket to the demands of the local community.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morrisons’ new chief plans to tailor the products in each supermarket to the demands of the local community.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Potts was appointed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/16/david-potts-first-day-ceo-morrisons-northern-supermarket\">chief executive of Morrisons</a> in February in an attempt to help the struggling Bradford-based supermarket return to the basics.</p> <p>Critics argue that former boss Dalton Philips alienated core shoppers by trying to take the retailer upmarket, for example by installing in-store misting machines to cool the fruit and vegetables. Philips said this was not the case, insisting that Morrisons needed to modernise to meet the demands of its shoppers, particularly in the south-east and London. He said it also needed emphasise the fact it made much of its own products and was one of the UK’s biggest food manufacturers. </p> <p>Philips suggested Morrisons was struggling because it entered the fast-growing online grocery market and convenience store sector later than its rivals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/10/morrisons-closures-and-waitrose-decline-underline-food-shoppings-revolution\">Potts aims to get Morrisons back on track</a> by tailoring the products in each supermarket to the demands of the local community, adding 5,000 staff to stores, making the company’s pricing and promotions simpler, and introducing in-store services such as mobile phone repairs. He has also closed shops and sold off the fledging M Local convenience store brand.</p> <p>However, Christmas will still be tough. Morrisons said like-for-like sales were down 2.6% in the 13 weeks to 1 November, mirroring a miserable performance in the same period last year.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\">Tesco</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe6f7239918f5606f7e14679a512df2c6aa55e74\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/fe6f7239918f5606f7e14679a512df2c6aa55e74/0_0_3617_2168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Despite attempts to reverse its fortunes, Tesco remains in decline.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despite attempts to reverse its fortunes, Tesco remains in decline.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain’s biggest retailer also has the sector’s biggest problems. It is more than year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/31/tesco-rescue-has-dave-lewiss-first-year-been-a-success\">since new its boss, Dave Lewis, arrived</a> and a major accounting scandal was uncovered. However, despite the chief executive’s drive to cut prices, improve customer service, and close more than 50 struggling shops, Tesco remains in decline.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/07/tesco-profits-more-than-halved\">The company’s latest results</a> showed a 1.1% fall in like-for-like sales in the UK, which is a smaller decline than Sainsbury’s. However, operating profits were just £166m. To put that into context, Sainsbury’s is making almost double the profit despite generating almost half the sales – £12.4bn compared with Tesco’s £21.6bn. This means that Tesco is throwing money at trying to win back sales, but with limited impact. </p> <p>Tesco still has more than 3,500 stores in the UK, far more than Sainsbury’s 1,200. Lewis revealed this week that between 2007 and 2014 Tesco opened 35m sq ft of new shop space, the equivalent of twice the size of Asda today, but that group sales have gone nowhere during that time. As a consequence, Tesco is more exposed to the impact of changing shopping habits than its rivals.</p> <p>This, coupled with the damage to the Tesco brand, a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the accounting scandal, billions of pounds of debt, and poor staff morale due to the scrapping of the company’s final salary pension scheme and job losses, means turning around the famous retailer will take years.</p> <p>Lewis appears to be braced for a tough Christmas. Tesco enjoyed a better sales performance than its rivals in the 2014 festive season as the new boss enjoyed a honeymoon period. However, this was underpinned by issuing millions of money-off vouchers to shoppers and offering sharp discounts on Black Friday, which led to police being called to stores. Lewis says the company will not be repeating some of the tactics it used last year and will have to hold firm through what could be a testing time.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971142","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405091","internalRevision":"2743","internalContentCode":"458367037","publication":"The

on targets including the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, the FBI and the UN Children’s Fund, a media report alleges.</p> <p>The latest news report on the BND spy service will fuel a debate in Germany about state surveillance kicked off by the revelations of the US whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p> <p>The claims are awkward for the chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose office oversees Germany’s intelligence activities. She told Washington in 2013 that “spying among friends isn’t on” following reports that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/08/nsa-tapped-german-chancellery-decades-wikileaks-claims-merkel\">bugged her mobile phone</a>.</p> <p>The latest report, by Berlin public radio, adds to the list of targets the BND has allegedly spied on. According to RBB Inforadio, which did not name its sources, the service spied on Fabius, the international court of justice in The Hague, the US FBI and the United Nations bodies Unicef and the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>The report also claims the service monitored Hansjörg Haber, a German citizen who from 2008 to 2011 was head of the EU’s observer mission in Georgia and then a senior diplomat in Brussels. He is now head of the EU’s mission in Turkey and married to a state secretary in the interior ministry. </p> <p>German citizens are protected by the country’s constitution and not allowed to be spied on. Privacy is a sensitive issue in Germany due to extensive surveillance by communist East Germany’s Stasi secret police and by the Nazi-era Gestapo. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/07/german-secret-service-bnd-restricts-cooperation-nsa-us-online-surveillance-spy\">German secret service BND reduces cooperation with NSA</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also on the list, according to the RBB report, were “many European and American companies, including weapons makers such as Lockheed of the United States.”</p> <p>German media have previously reported that the BND spied in cooperation with the NSA on the French presidency and foreign ministry, the European commission and other targets. </p> <p>Asked about the latest allegations, the BND declined to comment. A government spokeswoman, Christiane Wirtz, questioned for about 20 minutes at a regular news conference, declined to comment directly on the report and said the oversight body worked “without discussing everything in public”. </p> <p>Wirtz pledged a full investigation. “The duties of the BND do not include political reconnaissance work against partner countries,” she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/06/angela-merkel-pressure-reveal-us-spying-agreement-nsa\">Angela Merkel under pressure to reveal all about US spying agreement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She added that the BND chief, Gerhard Schindler, still had the “full confidence of the German government”.

should receive the same treatment as shoplifters as he joined forces with the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, to promise the public that the scandal-hit financial sector was being cleansed of wrongdoing.</p> <p>The chancellor said he understood the anger felt by voters towards bankers guilty of multimillion pound rip-offs and said they should be treated like other criminals if they broke the law.<br /></p> <p>In a combined show of intent by the UK’s top economic policy makers at an event designed to tackle public disquiet over the state of one of the economy’s most important sectors, Carney said there was still work to do to root out the City’s “bad apples”.</p> <p>The governor and the chancellor were speaking at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/bank-of-england-chief-to-host-forum-on-how-to-make-markets-safe\">an initiative by the Bank to justify the purpose of financial markets</a> after the banking crisis and market-rigging scandals in the interest rate and current markets. These events had shown the markets were “fragile, unfair, ineffective and unaccountable”, Carney said.</p> <p>Osborne used his appearance at the Open Forum – a gathering of bankers, policy makers, academics and members of the public – to justify tougher action against those who manipulated financial markets.</p> <p>The chancellor said fines on the industry were working, saying “if anyone thought that being unethical in the financial services industry is a good way to make money I suggest they look at the very big fines” levied on the industry. US, UK and European banks have been fined more than $150bn by international authorities since 2009.</p> <p>Osborne said he totally understood the public’s anger at the bankers, who had been responsible for the “biggest single economic crash of our lifetimes”.</p> <p>He added that there were punishments for shoplifters but “if you rip off people to the tune of millions of pounds, there are no criminal offences”.</p> <p>“If you go and shoplift at the local WH Smiths you go to prison, but if you’re the market trader on the trading floor of a big investment bank and you rip off people to the tune of millions of pounds, there are no criminal offences available to deal with you,” said Osborne. He had now changed the rules, he said.</p> <p>Carney said that under new rules to be introduced in the New Year, senior managers would have to ensure that junior traders and fund managers knew what a “true market” was. Despite a series of changes to the way the City operated there was still more to be done. Some rules may need to be rethought, he said.</p> <p>“The era of ‘heads I win; tails you lose’ capitalism is drawing to a close. Complex webs of derivatives are being simplified and made safer. We are also working to turn the tide of ethical drift,” Carney said.</p> <p>In an interview with Sky News, Carney said: “There is still work to root out those bad apples but I think we’ve got to recognise that there is a lot of good in financial services. It makes a huge difference to our economy.”</p> <p>Carney spoke of the need for the Open Forum <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/mark-carney-to-warn-rogue-city-traders-they-should-face-10-years-in-jail\">at the Mansion House speech in July</a> and called for 10-year prison sentences to clamp down on bad behaviour. Only a third of people believe markets work in the interest of society, the governor said.</p> <p>The event took place at a time when the industry is questioning some of the rules put in place since the 2008 crisis to make bankers more accountable and banks less likely to need taxpayer bailouts and markets more difficult to rig. </p> <p>Referring to these changes, Carney said: “Misconduct will be met with genuine penalties. By holding individuals accountable, authorities are ending the age of irresponsibility.”</p> <p>But the governor acknowledged changes to the rules might be needed: “Given the complexity and scale of financial reform, it would be remarkable if every measure were perfectly constructed. Or if they all fit seamlessly into a totally coherent, self-reinforcing whole.”</p> <p>Just a handful of the 400 or so audience members raised their hands when asked it if was case of “job done” in terms of regulatory reform.</p> <p>Tracey McDermott, acting chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, was asked if the regulator was going soft on the City after imposing a wave of fines and compensation payouts. “We can’t have a sustainable regulatory framework, can’t have customer trust … unless we are actually starting to look … at what we want the future to look like,” she said. </p> <p>She added later: “I am not going soft on the banks … If we take the stick away the carrot won’t be useful.”</p> <p> </p> <p>

drums on the first Beatles hit but spent his life on the edges of fame, has died aged 85, colleagues have said.</p> <p>White, from Glasgow, who had lived for years in the US where he taught Scottish-style pipes and drums, died in his adopted home of New Jersey, said the New York Metro Pipe Band.</p> <p>White performed on only one single of the Beatles – the US version of Love Me Do – but it was enough to make him a mythic “Fifth Beatle”.</p> <p>The drummer told the Daily Record in 2012 that producer Ron Richards had called him in 1962 and offered him a three-hour session job for label EMI. “I had heard of the Beatles because my first wife Lynne was from Liverpool and had mentioned the name, but I didn’t know much about them.” </p> <p>Ringo Starr, who played tambourine on the US single, assumed full-time drumming duties and performed on the British version of Love Me Do.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405674","internalRevision":"122","internalContentCode":"458371874","publication":"The

The project was first granted planning permission and listed building consent in 2008, and a smaller scheme was given listed building consent in 2010.</p> <p>In 2011, the Crown Estates, freehold owners of the property and the French embassy building, granted a limited licence to allow certain works of excavation to go ahead. The French government challenged the validity of certificates of lawfulness granted by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea last April to allow completion of the basement.</p> <p>W Robert Griffiths QC, appearing for the French authorities, argued the listed building and lawful development certificates were both flawed for a number of reasons and should be quashed.</p> <p>Griffiths said there had been lack of consultation, and the excavation works already carried out did not amount to commencement of development but were works of repair and refurbishment under the Hunts’ lease.</p> <p>If the French government win their case, it could lead to the Hunts having to make fresh applications to finish the work – under stricter conditions now being imposed for basement developments by the local planning authority.</p> <p>Paul Brown QC, appearing for the Hunts, told the judge any technical “breach” of the regulations had now been cured and there was no genuine case against them. He said “They are acting lawfully. They have permission.”</p> <p>The French authorities had taken legal action because “they don’t want[Hunt] to complete the basement,” said Brown.</p> <p>In 2007, Hunt sold the Foxtons estate agencies chain for £370m just weeks before the credit crunch hit and the property market slumped.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10972812","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405667","internalRevision":"230","internalContentCode":"458371855","publication":"The

Politically, it’s impossible for the biggest recipient of EU grants, which we have been, to be a country that has deliberately chosen to leave the EU. It’s just not going to happen.” </p> <p>A Brexit could, in any event, have a significant impact on the makeup of British universities’ student and academic bodies. According to Universities UK, more than 15% of teaching and research staff at Britain’s 132 universities are non-British EU nationals, including some of the most highly regarded researchers in the country: more than half the European Research Council’s (ERC) prestigious mid-career grants in UK universities are held by researchers from other EU countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c6a7a77da90b18eec070de9d83928d86e3bf39d9\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c6a7a77da90b18eec070de9d83928d86e3bf39d9/0_0_1643_2464/667.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Goodfellow, vice-chancellor of the University of Kent\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Goodfellow, vice-chancellor of the University of Kent, said her institution was ‘built around the EU’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Furthermore, British students benefit from EU freedom of movement rules: more than 200,000 UK students and 20,000 university staff have studied or worked at European universities under the <a href=\"https://erasmusplus.org.uk/\">Erasmus</a> scheme – including nearly 15,000 undergraduates and more than 2,000 academics in the last academic year. EU students make up about 5% of the UK student body (and contribute, according to one recent estimate, £2.7bn to the British economy).</p> <p>Some universities are more European. <a href=\"https://www.kent.ac.uk/ovc/vice-chancellor/vice-chancellor.html\">Dame Julia Goodfellow</a>, vice-chancellor of the University of Kent, which has study centres in Paris, Brussels, Athens and Rome, said nearly a quarter of her academic staff were non-British EU citizens. “This university is built around the European Union,” Goodfellow said.</p> <p>British universities also have access to European money beyond research grants. Several have used cash and loans from the EU’s regional development, structural or cohesion funds to build new education or research infrastructure such as laboratories or lecture theatres; Swansea this year opened a major £475m science and innovation campus that could not have been built without EU help.</p> <p>“I’m convinced that all our universities would be far poorer, in every sense, if Britain left,” said Goodfellow. “It would seriously dent our capacity to compete, and we’d be toying with our young people’s future – they need, all of them and more than ever, an international outlook.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/education_funding_top_15/giv-31114R1STwNrq1ef4/\" data-alt=\"Top 15 recipients\"> <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/education_funding_top_15/giv-31114R1STwNrq1ef4/\">Top 15 recipients</a> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.exeter.ac.uk/about/organisation/management/vicechancellor/\">Sir Steve Smith, the vice-chancellor of Exeter University</a>, said bluntly: “Leaving would be a disaster. Of course, it would damage UK research and universities in terms of attracting the best staff, students and funding. But to be honest, that’s not the biggest issue.”</p> <p>Smith, an international relations theorist, said “all the evidence in the world” shows that “the best research is done by people working internationally”. He added: “The most successful knowledge economy is where people publish together with people in other countries. EU membership makes that immeasurably easier.”</p> <p>By this yardstick the UK does “unbelievably well”, Smith said. In 1981, 84% of UK research was published bearing just a UK address; by last year, the figure was 48%. In the US, it remains 67%. </p> <p>That fact alone – that a higher proportion of UK than US research is authored by scientists of more than one nationality – explained why Britain, which represents just 0.9% of the global population, 3.2% of research and development expenditure and 4.1% of researchers, <a href=\"http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20131209172931625\">now accounted for 15.9% of the world’s most highly-cited scientific research articles</a>, Smith said – a score that put it in first position globally, ahead of the US.</p> <p>“Ultimately,” Smith added, “it’s about the quality of the work. Even if you could make up the funding shortfall from leaving the EU, you would be running counter to the way the world knowledge economy is moving.”<br /></p> <p>Major multi-partner health projects involving up to 25 countries such as EuroCoord, which seeks to improve the lives of people with HIV, or the Swiss-based Human Brain Project, which could ultimately help find cures for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, would be difficult if not impossible without EU backing, <a href=\"http://wonkhe.com/blogs/what-has-the-european-union-ever-done-for-us/\">said Alistair Jarvis of Universities UK</a>. </p> <p>With Britain’s own national research budget below international averages and under increasing pressure, European funding’s share of UK universities’ total income has risen by over 30% in five years, to as much as 15% or more in some cases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/education_funding_top_10/giv-31114oJ2UK82MPTSe/\" data-alt=\"Education research grants: top 10\"> <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/education_funding_top_10/giv-31114oJ2UK82MPTSe/\">Education research grants: top 10</a> </figure>  <p>And proportionately, British universities do very well indeed out of the pooled EU resources. The UK contributes just over 11% of the EU’s budget, but during the last seven-year EU funding programme, known as FP7, won 15.5% – about €7bn (£5bn) – of the sums awarded. Last year alone, under the current Horizon 2020 funding programme, British institutions secured £687m of EU research funding. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>“Leaving the EU would be a major threat to the overall international success of the UK sector, which punches well above its weight for a relatively small amount of government funding compared to other countries,” said <a href=\"http://www.abdn.ac.uk/about/management/principals-biography-68.php\">Sir Ian Diamond, vice-chancellor of the University of Aberdeen</a>. “For my university, it would certainly be one of the biggest threats we could face in terms of maintaining our quality.”</p> <p>Universities, Diamond said, were first and foremost about “teaching the next generation, who will be part of a global community in a way I was not. There’s no question that the EU facilitates that, and any closing up will not be good. Nor will it make my job of recruiting the best staff any easier .”</p> <p>The UK also does disproportionately well out of EU academic mobility and foreign exchange programmes such as the Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions (Maca), which allow European university staff members to spend periods of time working abroad. British institutions collected almost €1.1bn, or nearly one quarter of the total pool available, over the duration of FP7.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/education_funding_universities/giv-31114vsb7NkPqbjQu/\" data-alt=\"EU funding\"> <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/education_funding_universities/giv-31114vsb7NkPqbjQu/\">EU funding</a> </figure>  <p>And in the most prestigious research programme of all, the ERC, whose grants are awarded solely on the basis of research excellence, UK-based research has so far secured more than a fifth of all funds disbursed. From 2007-13, in fact, four British institutions – Oxford, Cambridge, UCL and Imperial – were among the 10 most successful recipients, between them hosting some 380 ERC projects, each worth between €1.5m and €2.5m and typically employing a team of six top scientists. </p> <p>“The point is that the European Union is the body through which all this funding is channelled and all this international collaboration organised,” said <a href=\"https://www.reading.ac.uk/15/about/people/about-bell.aspx\">Sir David Bell, vice-chancellor of Reading University</a>,</p> <p>“If we left, all that infrastructure would have to be replaced – and there’s no indication of how the UK would be treated. And what a signal we’d be sending … Unless we get some clear answers on what an exit would really mean, especially in terms of free movement of labour, it represents a clear and present danger.”

department has arrested a suspect accused of making online threats against black students and faculty. <br /></p> <p>A post early on Wednesday on the university’s emergency alert website said the suspect was in university police custody and was not on or near the university campus when the threats were made. A dispatcher at the university’s police department said more information would be released later on Wednesday. <br /></p> <p>The university said it had increased security and was investigating online threats on Tuesday, after weeks of protests over racial tensions on campus culminated in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/09/university-of-missouri-president-resigns-tim-wolfe-racial-intolerance\">departure of two senior university officials</a>. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/10/racial-justice-advocates-university-of-missouri-won\">How racial justice advocates took on Mizzou and won</a> </p> </aside>  <p> A post on Tuesday night on the college’s website said campus police were “aware of social media threats” and were investigating. The university’s statement did not offer any further detail, but it came after at least two users posted threats on the anonymous location-based messaging app Yik Yak.</p> <p>One user threatened to “shoot every black person I see”. </p> <p>Another said: “Some of you are alright. Don’t go to campus tomorrow.” The message seemed to echo one that appeared on the website 4chan – a forum where racist and misogynistic comments are common – ahead of the deadly campus shooting at an Oregon community college last month. </p> <p>The posts were widely disseminated across the internet and local media. </p> <p>Campus police captain Brian Weimer told the Associated Press additional officers had already been posted to the campus before the university learned of the threats. University police were working with other state and local agencies to ensure the campus was secure, he said. </p> <p>A university spokesman could not immediately be reached for further comment, but the school’s online emergency information center tweeted: “There is no immediate threat to campus,” and asked students to not spread rumors. </p> <p>It has been a tumultuous week for the flagship campus of the University of Missouri system. </p> <p>The student government president reported in September that people shouted racial slurs at him from a passing pickup truck, galvanizing the weeks-long protest movement there. A graduate student went on hunger strike to demand the resignation of university system president Tim Wolfe over his handling of racial complaints, then more than 30 members of the Missouri football team went on strike in his support. Those developments came to a head on Monday with the resignation of Wolfe and, hours later, the top administrator of the Columbia campus, chancellor R Bowen Loftin, was forced out.</p> <p>A plaza that had been the site of a sit-in by protesters was entirely empty Tuesday night and only a handful of students were seen walking around campus. Police officers from the campus department and city of Columbia were on patrol.</p> <p>David Wallace, a spokesman for the student government group Missouri Students Association, said the group asked university officials to cancel classes Wednesday in light of the threats. </p> <p>Gaby Rodriguez, a senior, said she was at work when she heard about the threats. <br /> “It’s really disheartening and proves the point of why these protests and boycotts were necessary,” Rodriguez said. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt this unsafe at Mizzou,” she said, referring to the college by its nickname. </p> <p>Some students, faculty and alumni have said the protests and top leaders’ resignations are the culmination of years of racial tension. </p> <p>Among other recent events, members of the Legions of Black Collegians, whose founders include a recently retired deputy chancellor, said slurs were hurled at them by an apparently drunken white student while practicing for a homecoming performance. </p> <p>The university has promised changes. </p> <p>Chuck Henson, a black law professor and associate dean, was appointed Tuesday as the university’s first-ever interim vice chancellor for inclusion, diversity and equity. <br /> The university system’s governing body, the Board of Curators, also announced a number of other initiatives, including more support for the hiring and retention of diverse faculty and staff and a full review of all policies related to staff and student conduct. </p> <h2>Timeline of recent events at University of Missouri</h2> <p><strong>14 August:</strong> The university announces the elimination of subsidies that help pay health insurance costs for graduate students employed by the school. </p> <p><strong>26 August:</strong> Graduate students stage a walkout and rally, in part to oppose the health care cut. </p> <p><strong>12 September:</strong> Missouri Student Association president Payton Head posts on Facebook that young people in a pickup truck yelled racial slurs at him. It is the first of many racial incidents on the Columbia campus this fall. Sit-ins, walkouts and other protests follow, fueled by concern that administrators are not addressing the tension. </p> <p><strong>16 September:</strong> The university and Planned Parenthood announce the end of their 26-year relationship after state lawmakers start investigating abortions performed at the university clinics. </p> <p><strong>24 September:</strong> A “Racism Lives Here” rally takes place on campus.</p> <p><strong>29 September:</strong> An estimated 1,000 protesters turn out for a rally in support of Planned Parenthood. </p> <p><strong>5 October:</strong> A drunk man yells racial slurs at members of the Legion of Black Collegians. Chancellor R Bowen Loftin, on Twitter and in a video message, expresses anger at the slurs. </p> <p><strong>6 October:</strong> Students and faculty stage a sit-in against racism and administrative inaction. </p> <p><strong>8 October:</strong> The university announces that freshmen will be required to undergo diversity training beginning in January, and the program will eventually be expanded to include all students, faculty and staff. </p> <p><strong>10 October:</strong> A group of demonstrators seeking university system president Tim Wolfe’s attention interrupt the homecoming parade. Police threaten them with pepper spray, and Wolfe declines to get out of his car to speak with them. Many consider that proof of his unwillingness to hear their concerns. He later apologizes, but the damage is done. </p> <p><strong>11 October:</strong> A third “Racism Lives Here” rally is broken up by university police and cut short. </p> <p><strong>14 October:</strong> Loftin tells faculty members that the university changed course and will be able to cover health insurance payments for graduate assistants for the foreseeable future. </p> <p><strong>20 October:</strong> The group Concerned Student 1950 (the name refers to the first year blacks were admitted at the school) issues a list of demands that includes Wolfe’s removal. </p> <p><strong>21 October:</strong> The university announces new contracts with Planned Parenthood. </p> <p><strong>24 October:</strong> A swastika is drawn with feces in a dorm bathroom, the second antisemitic incident in a residence hall this year. </p> <p><strong>27 October: </strong>Members of Concerned Student 1950 meet with Wolfe, without resolution. </p> <p><strong>2 November:</strong> Graduate student Jonathan Butler begins a hunger strike, vowing not to eat until he dies or Wolfe is removed. Wolfe issues a statement the following day expressing concern about Butler and saying he was willing to discuss ways to affect change. </p> <p><strong>4 November:</strong> The English Department votes 26-0 to show no confidence in Loftin’s leadership. </p> <p><strong>5 November:</strong> Students, faculty and staff stage a walkout in support of Butler’s hunger strike. </p> <p><strong>6 November:</strong> Wolfe, in a statement, apologizes for the homecoming parade incident and again expresses concern about Butler. </p> <p><strong>7 November:</strong> Black football players announce they will not practice or play football until Wolfe is gone. Within hours, the rest of the team joins in the boycott. </p> <p><strong>8 November:</strong> The remainder of the football team joins in the boycott, threatening cancellation of the 14 November game against Brigham Young University. A tweet from coach Gary Pinkel includes a photo of nearly 100 players and coaches and reads, in part, “The Mizzou Family stands as one.” Wolfe releases a statement saying he will not resign. </p> <p><strong>9 November:</strong> A tumultuous day begins with an emergency meeting of the system’s governing board and Wolfe resigns. Butler immediately ends his hunger strike. Loftin soon resigns as chancellor, saying he will direct the development of research facilities. </p> <p><strong>10 November:</strong> The university appoints an interim vice chancellor for inclusion, diversity and equity, a new position. The university said it also plans to review all policies related to staff and student conduct; to provide more support to victims of discrimination; and to work toward employing a more diverse faculty and staff.

Comments included: “If there’s consent is it paedophilia?”; “She’s gonna be a porn star at 12”; “This sexy girl is to blame for paedophilia”, and “Valentina doing those dishes: what a bitch”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/12/brazil-tough-laws-violence-against-women-stymied-by-social-norms\">Brazil's tough laws on violence against women stymied by social norms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The slew of online comments prompted Think Olga, an NGO working for women’s rights, to <a href=\"http://thinkolga.com/2015/10/26/hashtag-transformacao-82-mil-tweets-sobre-o-primeiroassedio/\">create the hashtag #primeiroassédio</a> (first harassment), encouraging women to tell stories about the first time they had been assaulted.</p> <p>Stories of catcalling, inappropriate touching, abuse and rape were quickly shared online, and an analysis of 3,111 tweets found that the average age at which girls were first assaulted was just nine.</p> <p>Juliana de Faria, the founder of Think Olga, said the response reflected the extent to which paedophilia has come to be “normalised” in Brazil. “The great achievement of this campaign is [raising awareness], because you can’t fight against something that you don’t believe in or deny has taken place,” she said.</p> <p>“A machine has been working to keep victims in silence. It isn’t operated by a super-villian, but manifests itself every time we’re told that we’re exaggerating, that we need to forget, that ‘what has happened has happened’ … There is something very powerful in discovering that we are victims.”</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://thinkolga.com/2015/10/26/hashtag-transformacao-82-mil-tweets-sobre-o-primeiroassedio/\">#primeiroassédio</a> campaign has prompted women to share shocking experiences on Twitter:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"@kumpera tweet\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;pt&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/primeiroassedio?src=hash&quot;&gt;#primeiroassedio&lt;/a&gt; 9 anos, morava em uma fazenda e um dos funcionários do meu pai tentou me estuprar.

While “lesbian”, “stepmom” and “milf” ranked the highest in he US and UK, “novinha” (young girl) and “teen” were the two highest in Brazil.</p> <p>Faria said the word novinha “has become part of our national culture – and it’s very dangerous … The term is not just about innocently celebrating life, it’s about the pursuit of sex. What we are faced with is a culture in which paedophilia masquerades as a joke.”</p> <p>In response to the first harassment hashtag, social scientist Manoela Miklos has launched another online campaign – using the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/agora%C3%A9ques%C3%A3oelas\">#‎AgoraÉQueSãoElas</a> (now it’s her turn) – which saw women taking over the blogs and columns of influential male writers for one week to tackle women’s issues in Brazil.</p> <p>“I was troubled by the narratives in the media about the abuse stories,” said Miklos. “The people talking about the rising female voice were men. Men speaking about the importance of listening to women, but still speaking, not listening. So I posed a question: what if they really listened instead of just talking about listening?</p> <p>“#primeiroassédio showed us the scale of the unspoken. We wanted to take these reflections from a personal to a public level – from catharsis to an articulate demand for rights.”</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.ipea.gov.br/portal/images/stories/PDFs/nota_tecnica/140327_notatecnicadiest11.pdf\">recent study</a> by Ipea (a Brazilian institute of applied economics research) found that of the 527,000 people raped each year in Brazil, 89% were female and 70% were children or adolescents. The report found that around one in five child rape victims were male.<br /></p> <p>However, Ipea estimates that only 10% of rape cases are reported in the country, and Brazil was ranked 79th in the 2014 UN <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-5-gender-related-development-index-gdi\">gender equality index</a>, behind Kazakhstan and Iran.</p> <p>Ana Paula Meirelles Lewin, co-ordinator of the centre for the public defence of women’s rights in São Paulo, said: “In Brazil, what prevails is a macho, sexist and misogynistic culture. It is a country where people cannot talk openly about gender and sexuality.”</p> <p>Miklos said that women in Brazil are “losing the few rights we have, the little freedom we have … But we are fighting back. It is the women’s spring in Brazil.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10969744","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2402184","internalRevision":"1864","internalContentCode":"458342970","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"After abusive tweets to 12-year-old TV show contestant, thousands of women and girls take to social media to share experiences of harassment and assault ","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Explicit tweets to Junior MasterChef star in Brazil spark campaign against abuse","byline":"Anna Sophie Gross in Rio de Janeiro","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T07:00:11Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/061a9c4859b4764f6c1ef1d5b8ff244e2138e2a2/0_66_940_564/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563b8a4be4b04f2498368e41","newspaperPageNumber":"29","standfirst":"<p>After abusive tweets to 12-year-old TV show contestant, thousands of women and girls take to social media to share experiences of harassment and assault </p>","creationDate":"2015-11-05T16:56:43Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T00:55:02.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/11/brazil-explicit-tweets-junior-masterchef-star-online-campaign-against-abuse-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/nov/11/brazil-explicit-tweets-junior-masterchef-star-online-campaign-against-abuse-sexual-harassment","sectionName":"Global development","elements":[{"id":"061a9c4859b4764f6c1ef1d5b8ff244e2138e2a2","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/061a9c4859b4764f6c1ef1d5b8ff244e2138e2a2/0_66_940_564/500.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/061a9c4859b4764f6c1ef1d5b8ff244e2138e2a2","altText":"Contestants in Brazil’s 2015 Junior MasterChef TV show.","caption":"Contestants in Brazil’s 2015 Junior MasterChef TV show.

Leafs by Snoop products are to first be sold exclusively at licensed Colorado cannabis shop LivWell, before being rolled out to other shops by the end of November, according to marijuana-focused site <a href=\"http://www.thecannabist.co/2015/11/10/snoop-dogg-marijuana-leafs-by-snoop/43585/\">the Cannabist</a>. </p> <p>Throughout his rap career, Snoop has performed such subtly titled songs as Smoke Weed Everyday, Smoke the Weed, Smoke the Weed and This Weed Iz Mine.</p> <p>“Since I’ve been at the forefront of this movement for over 20 years now, I’m a master of marijuana,” said Snoop, at the brand launch event. “Leafs By Snoop is truly the first mainstream cannabis brand in the world and proud to be a pioneer.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/21/snoop-dogg-founds-media-company-merry-jane\">Snoop Dogg founds media company that merges 'cannabis and pop culture'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This year has also seen country music icon Willie Nelson announce plans to release <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/27/willie-nelson-to-open-chain-of-marijuana-stores\">his own brand of marijuana</a>, dubbed Willie’s Reserve. </p> <p>Though Snoop’s name is attached to the brand, the Cannabist reports that as a non-resident of Colorado the rapper can not technically own Leafs by Snoop. </p> <p>Colorado legalised both the medical and recreational use of marijuana in 2012.

ease with which the ultra rich can avoid paying tax, has put “an almost impossible constraint” on chancellors, the veteran former Conservative minister Ken Clarke has said.</p> <p>As a result, the onus has fallen heavily on cutting spending. Speaking before the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/spending-review-2015\">spending review</a>, which will determine the role of the state over the next four years, Clarke said the pressure of an ageing population will mean it will become the norm to work until the age of 75.</p> <p>He added that a changing climate of public opinion may mean it will be possible for the state to cut back the generosity of pensioner benefits.</p> <p>Speaking at a seminar in London, he said: “Obviously there must be someone in government who thinks the triple lock is affordable for future generations, but the only part of my income that is going up is my state retirement pension really quite markedly in real terms.</p> <p>“Policy changes are required. Awareness of the treatment of pensioners is spreading a little among the public and we may be able to make some moves.”</p> <p>He predicted a huge backlash, saying: “ I expect if you ever have the nerve to try to challenge these things pensioners will be as furious as the junior doctors when you turn down their pay claim.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f7e8c286317bf57872dc8984a8b13a1225959eb\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6f7e8c286317bf57872dc8984a8b13a1225959eb/0_230_4746_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Osborne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Does George Osborne have an impossible job?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clarke admitted ministers were finding it very difficult to find ways to pare back spending in the current spending round.</p> <p>In an iconoclastic address, he said:</p> <ul> <li>Tax credits were a “state bung” that drove down labour productivity.</li> <li>A “false calm” had descended on the European economy since interest rates will soon have to rise representing a serious challenge on the finances of many western governments.<br /></li> <li>The public has “not seen anything yet” in terms of the reforms that will be imposed on the health service due to demographic pressures .<br /></li> <li>UK penal policy for the past 20 years has been run by the Sun newspaper with the cost of keeping someone in jail the equivalent of sending them to Eton.<br /></li> </ul> <p>He also blamed the housing shortage in Britain on “the well-heeled” being able to hire an army of consultants and lawyers to mount planning objections, adding “the only thing that will rouse the passions of the English middle class is the suggestion that you may build anything within five miles of where they live”. </p> <p>But the bulk of his remarks at a Resolution Foundation seminar this week were devoted to the new constraints that have been placed on modern chancellors by a public that refuses to countenance tax rises and governments too nervous to make the rational case for such increases.</p> <p>He said: “Nobody can raise taxes except from a tiny proportion of the ultra rich that you don’t know and are probably foreign. Other taxes are never to go up. It is an almost impossible constraint and requires chancellors to smuggle tax rises into parliament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f830e2c944188bcd4dc927d6af29133d69bbb8c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6f830e2c944188bcd4dc927d6af29133d69bbb8c/0_138_1453_871/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Major\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clarke served as chancellor in John Major’s government.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Duncan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It is an essential part of financing the activities of the state, but it is now regarded as a political no-no nowadays for people of most political complexion, so you reduce public spending.”<br /></p> <p>He recalled how as chancellor he tried to target spending so that it was no more than 40 % of GDP. Spending as a proportion of GDP is set to fall to 36%.</p> <p>As chancellor he had raised taxes and lowered public spending, saying: “Which is what chancellors that I admire before me had always done. Politics was different then – people did not expect budgets always to be popular. They did expect budgets to have things they did not like in them.</p> <p>“People even expected even popular budgets would have things they did not like. People understood it was the government’s best judgment, right or wrong, of what was in the national interest.”</p> <p>He added that apart from the short-term nature of modern government, ministers were up against the underlying feature of public opinion –resistance to change– including an increasing aversion to reductions in spending that may affect them and their families and any increase in taxation.</p> <p>“That is pretty primitive, but it is the underlying feature of public opinion. I am only describing the underlying human condition. It is not excessively cynical.”</p> <p> He said raising tax was like “the art of plucking the goose with the minimum of hisses”.</p> <p>“The secret to taxation is that most people will tell politicians and pollsters they are in favour of more taxes being raised from people that are richer than they ever expect to be themselves.</p> <p>“The basic problem is there are not enough of these rich people to raise serious sums of money. I would love to tax the filthy rich. They are so rich, powerful and international and they find it damned easy to avoid most of the bases of taxation we have got.”</p> <p>Rejecting the idea that Britain had experienced serious austerity, he said: “Electoral bribes, handing out money to people of all ages, has got out of hand. The trouble with electoral bribes is that they are damned difficult to take back because people do like being given money.”</p> <p> Referring to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/taxcredits\">tax credits</a>, he said: “To have a welfare state that just pays millions of people in work a kind of bung-on-top of their pay does explain why we are developing a low-pay, low-productivity, long hours economy, which is the distinguishing feature compared with the French, the Germans, the Americans and our competitors. It is an astonishing amount of welfare benefits that you get on top of your income”.</p> <p>In a properly functioning economy, he said, employers should be providing the income to its workforce. He added: “What we are finding it is damned difficult to tackle. We reached a stage where 90% of families in work got tax credits. It is a stupid name, tax credits. It is just a taxpayers bung on top of their pay.”</p> <p>He also questioned the past numbers on incapacity benefit, saying: “One in 12 of the adult population apparently was permanently incapable of any kind of work. Well I don’t know where they all are but I don’t think that sort of matches my daily personal experience. Policy changes are required, and as [Iain Duncan Smith] has discovered, they are damned difficult to tackle.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971653","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405567","internalRevision":"663","internalContentCode":"458371128","publication":"The

Hoare had denied any involvement in the plot, the killing or the aftermath but was convicted of Becky’s manslaughter and helping dismember and hide the body.</p> <p> Matthews claimed that he alone had accidentally killed Becky when a kidnap plot designed to teach her a lesson for the way she supposedly treated Anjie went wrong.</p> <p> But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/11/nathan-matthews-shauna-hoare-becky-watts-dark-fantasies-reality\">detectives unearthed a much more sinister motive</a>. They discovered texts in which Matthews and Hoare exchanged messages about kidnapping petite teenage girls for sex. Their phones and computers were used to access pornography focused on teenagers, young women dressed as schoolgirls and threesomes, and their laptop contained a 17-minute video of a young woman being raped in her own home.</p> <p> For the first time it can also be reported that a stash of 19,000 explicit – but legal – images of young women was found on a hard drive at the couple’s cluttered Bristol home.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>And it can also be revealed that Becky had complained to a friend that Matthews had once touched her on the leg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b5006b73cf6c033e8edbeeab833d7ecb5cd8e58\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3b5006b73cf6c033e8edbeeab833d7ecb5cd8e58/0_136_1323_795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Matthews and Shauna Hoare in a 99p store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Matthews and Shauna Hoare in a 99p store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Avon &amp; Somerset police/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In February, Matthews and Hoare targeted Becky, aiming to use her as their “sexual plaything”. The pair went to her home equipped with a “kidnap kit” including stun guns and handcuffs. Becky was suffocated in her bedroom in an attack that left her with 40 bruises all over her body.<br /></p> <p> She was stabbed in the stomach 15 times after her death. Matthews and Hoare then took her body back to their home, ordered a takeaway, played a board game and later set about dismembering Becky’s body with a circular saw. They packed the remains in plastic and salt and hid them in a garden shed.</p> <p> The nature of the crime means Matthews could join a small group of killers – such as Moors murderer Ian Brady and serial killer Rose West, who were given full-life tariffs – when the sentencing takes place on Friday. He bowed his head as the verdicts were returned. Hoare, who is likely to face a very long minimum term, stared ahead before dabbing tears in her eyes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/11/becky-watts-shy-girl-growing-confidence\">Becky Watts: a shy girl who was growing in confidence</a> </p> </aside>  <p> After the verdicts, senior investigating officer Det Supt Mike Courtiour said Matthews had shown no remorse and described his crime as “gruesome, horrific, despicable … barbaric”. Hoare has claimed she was physically and psychologically abused by Matthews but Courtiour said she was “very, very calculating”.</p> <p> Courtiour added: “Though he admitted manslaughter, Matthews has never taken full responsibility for his actions. He has forced Becky’s family and friends to undergo the trauma of a lengthy and distressing trial. Shauna Hoare has never admitted her role, demonstrating her cold-blooded nature.”</p> <p> The officer also said he thought another 16-year-old girl was “lucky” after coming to the attention of Matthews and Hoare before they pounced on Becky. The pair were attracted to the girl, who cannot be named, and Hoare approached her via Facebook. Nothing came of the approach.</p> <p> In a statement, Tanya Watts, Becky’s grandmother Pat and brother Daniel paid tribute to Becky. “She was like a tornado, hurricane and sunbeam all at once. She came into your life and made you feel alive.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbb2ee2f125704bffae0b30e06b1c1082af0ad94\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/bbb2ee2f125704bffae0b30e06b1c1082af0ad94/0_0_5164_3100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Matthews and Shauna Hoare\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Matthews and Shauna Hoare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Avon and Somerset police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> They thanked the staff at Flax Bourton mortuary, saying: “We do not underestimate how they went above and beyond their duty ensuring we had the opportunity to see Becky one last time. It was something that gave us great comfort.”</p> <p> The family members added: “We loved Becky. We can tell you that she was a beautiful, happy, funny, feisty, caring, loyal and witty girl. We would urge everyone who has teenagers to listen to your kids; don’t ignore or dismiss what they are trying to say. If they are feeling worried about something, take your time to listen to them.”</p> <p> Speaking to the BBC, Darren Galsworthy said: “There’s only one way to pay for this sort of crime – and that’s by losing their own lives.” Galsworthy said he and his wife Anjie had been through “hell on earth”.</p> <p> He said: “It has been horrendous. I wouldn’t put my worst enemy through it. I was so desperate to get her back … It was ripping my heart out. She was my youngest … the devastation and heartbreak is indescribable.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/oct/08/cctv-nathan-matthews-circular-saw-becky-watts-murder-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4d6vz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2386041\"            data-video-name=\"Becky Watts' step-brother Nathan Matthews shops for circular saw – video\"            data-video-provider=\"CCTV/Police\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/10/8/1444324005394/KP_524478_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5616a2aee4b0e20abc6ba7a0\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/10/8/1444324004949/KP_524477_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/10/08/151008beckywatts_1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/10/08/151008beckywatts_1_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/10/08/151008beckywatts_1_synd_768k_vp8-1.webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/10/08/151008beckywatts_1_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/10/08/151008beckywatts_1.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/oct/08/cctv-nathan-matthews-circular-saw-becky-watts-murder-video\">CCTV shows Nathan Matthews buying a circular saw – video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p> Galsworthy added: “Nathan was so arrogant he thought he could get away with it.

areas face the double disadvantage of poverty and geography that means they abandon education earlier than their peers in better-off areas, according to new research by Oxford University.</p> <p>The findings, <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/\">commissioned by the Sutton Trust</a>, reveal the powerful and long-lasting influence of background in shaping educational outcomes and suggest that income is only partly responsible for the variations in levels of education by different groups.</p> <p>The research found that just 29% of white working class boys from deprived neighbourhoods in England go on to take A-levels or AS-levels in sixth form, compared with 46% of white boys who came from the same economic background but lived in more affluent areas.</p> <p>A similar pattern was seen among white girls from working class backgrounds, although the gap was not as wide, and confirmed the success of pupils from Indian and Bangladeshi ethnic backgrounds. Half of all ethnic Indian pupils took three or more A-levels, as did 33% of those from Bangladeshi backgrounds.</p> <p>Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chair of the Sutton Trust, said the figures showed the government’s spending review later this month needed to address underachievement within England’s poorest communities.</p> <p>“It is shocking that so few white working class boys go on to take AS or A-levels. We must redouble our efforts to address these attainment gaps, and ensure that every pupil, regardless of family income, gender or ethnicity, has the chance to succeed,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/03/bright-children-disadvantaged-backgrounds-missing-talent-fail-achieve-gcse\">Bright children from disadvantaged backgrounds fall by the wayside at GCSE</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pam Sammons, <a href=\"http://www.education.ox.ac.uk/about-us/directory/professor-pam-sammons/\">professor of education at Oxford</a> and one of the report’s authors, said: “Disadvantaged students, especially white UK boys, have poorer outcomes, and living in a poor neighbourhood compounds this.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, although the pupil premium helps schools by providing extra resources for poor students, local authorities serving the poorest communities have been hardest hit by budget cuts during the last five years.”</p> <p>The study followed 3,000 pupils as part of the <a href=\"http://www.ioe.ac.uk/research/153.html\">Effective Pre-School, Primary and Secondary Education longitudinal project</a> running since the 1990s, and found that gender, ethnicity, location and economic status were likely to determine which groups continued on in education.</p> <p>It found that white students were less likely to progress on to taking AS or A-levels than students from other ethnic groups, while pupils living in poor or deprived areas were also less likely to do the same. And while boys were less likely than girls to go on to take A-levels, white boys from deprived backgrounds showed some of the lowest levels of progression overall.</p> <p>“Taken together, these results again point to the powerful influence of different aspects of student background in shaping educational outcomes, particularly for 17 and 18-year-olds at A-level,” the report noted.</p> <p>“The findings show that a range of factors remained important. They confirm that there is no ‘level playing field’ and that differences that emerged early in children’s lives continue to affect outcomes and life chances into adolescence.”</p> <p>The lower proportion of poor white boys taking qualifications such as A-levels means they are less likely to go on to higher education, restricting their access to professional or graduate-level employment.</p> <p>Recent <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8042\">research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> showed the proportion of white boys admitted to university was lower than almost all other ethnic groups in England.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/18/schools-need-to-avoid-selection-by-estate-agent-says-report\">Schools need to avoid 'selection by estate agent', says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The differences in higher education participation between pupils from different ethnic groups are staggering,” said Claire Crawford, an academic at Warwick University and an author of the IFS research.</p> <p>“We were particularly surprised to find that ethnic minority groups which have relatively low school attainment, such as those of black Caribbean, Pakistani or Bangladeshi ethnic origin, are, on average, more likely to continue into higher education than white British pupils.”</p> <p>The Oxford research noted that while two-thirds of all girls took AS, A-levels or another qualifications, only 55% of all boys did the same.</p> <p>“Working class underachievement is a scandal. Recent attention has been focused on the achievement of working class boys; this report highlights this is an issue for girls too,” said Becky Francis, professor of education at King’s College London.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Education said: “Too many young people still aren’t being given a fair shot to succeed because of where they live, which is why our education reforms are focused on delivering educational excellence everywhere.</p> <p>“We are ensuring schools are fairly funded and have already maintained per pupil funding and provided an extra £390m to the least fairly funded areas. Over the coming months we will be looking at what can be done to ensure that all local areas are funded justly.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10972399","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405564","internalRevision":"876","internalContentCode":"458371089","publication":"The

This isn’t an abstract thing anymore. It’s become a reality. ”</p> <p>The National Trust is drawing up erosion adaptation plans at 80 priority “hotspots” around the coast of England, Wales and Northern Ireland where erosion is expected to be particularly pronounced.</p> <p>At Formby, north of Liverpool, the sand dunes are rolling back at a rate of four metres each year but storms in the winter of 2013-14 caused a retreat of 30m. At Traeth Llanbedrog, north Wales, the trust has introduced climate change-friendly beach huts, which can be picked up and moved away from the coast to protect them from winter storms. In Birling Gap, East Sussex, the new National Trust visitor centre is designed to be “rolled back” from the rapidly crumbling cliffs.</p> <p>Other coastal beauty spots likely to be transformed by rising seas and increased storminess include St Michael’s Mount and Boscastle in Cornwall; Portstewart Strand, Northern Ireland; Studland, Dorset; Orford Ness, Suffolk; and Lindisfarne Castle in Northumberland.</p> <p>According to research by the National Trust, one in three coastal planning authorities has no plan or policy to deal with rising sea levels. Local authority planning teams have experienced a 46% budget reduction over the last five years.</p> <p>Dyke said the trust wants coastal adaptation – “moving out of harm’s way” – to be an “equal partner” with engineered solutions, such as concrete sea defences. While he said that many coastal communities will always be “defended to the hilt” – such as London with its Thames Barrier, or Portsmouth, an island city whose sea defences will need updating to cope with projected sea level rise – it may prove too expensive to defend wilder coastlines with orthodox sea walls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9f136cf1e8c650c278221a6b1a67697f6e82b78\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d9f136cf1e8c650c278221a6b1a67697f6e82b78/0_0_5671_3781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The eroded end of Beach Road, on the cliff edge at Happisburgh in Norfolk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The eroded end of Beach Road, on the cliff edge at Happisburgh in Norfolk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Environment Agency <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381939/FCRM_Long_term_investment_scenarios.pdf\">predicts that 700 homes will be lost to the sea by 2030</a>. Under current law, the authorities have no obligation to compensate people for the loss of their homes, even if it was once protected by a sea wall. Dyke admitted that government compensation for homes lost to climate change would “open a can of worms” but said there should be more government help for vulnerable homeowners.</p> <p>He said he would like to see more experimental, government-funded schemes such <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/07/should-coastal-britain-surrender-to-tide\">as Happisburgh in Norfolk</a>. Five years ago, local residents at risk of losing their homes were given a “planning right” which they could use to build a new home inland or sell to the local authority. This enabled one street to be “rolled back” from the rapidly eroding cliffs.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10970797","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405214","internalRevision":"315","internalContentCode":"458367923","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"National Trust says central and local governments should plan ahead for increasing coastal erosion rather than talk of ‘holding the line’ ","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Britain 'must abandon Churchillian rhetoric' in face of rising seas","byline":"Patrick Barkham","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-12T07:01:03Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/5aa576b269c138df1d8ba3ed8d728ec79d07c388/0_115_5904_3542/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56432e1be4b091514c06d587","newspaperPageNumber":"13","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-15T07:01:03Z","standfirst":"<p>National Trust says central and local governments should plan ahead for increasing coastal erosion rather than talk of ‘holding the line’ </p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T12:01:31Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T11:18:32.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/12/britain-must-abandon-churchillian-rhetoric-in-face-of-rising-seas","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/12/britain-must-abandon-churchillian-rhetoric-in-face-of-rising-seas","sectionName":"Environment","elements":[{"id":"5aa576b269c138df1d8ba3ed8d728ec79d07c388","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/5aa576b269c138df1d8ba3ed8d728ec79d07c388/0_115_5904_3542/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Loop Images Ltd / Alamy Stock Photo","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/5aa576b269c138df1d8ba3ed8d728ec79d07c388","suppliersReference":"DYDG48","altText":"The Seven Sisters country park in East Sussex.

could lead to many thousands more women being offered hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/12/a-guide-to-the-menopause\">A guide to the menopause</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/NG23\">The guideline</a> from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), unveiled on Thursday, seeks to reassure women and their GPs about the safety of HRT. Studies suggesting a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/sep/20/hormone-replacement-therapy-cancer-lancet\">link with breast cancer</a>, published in 2002 and 2003, led to a halving of the numbers of women taking the drugs.<br /></p> <p>Nice says the guideline could benefit more than a million women, many of whom could be prescribed HRT as the most effective treatment for debilitating symptoms, which include hot flushes, night sweats, insomnia and mood swings. The aim, says Nice, is for women to not suffer in silence and feel able to discuss their options with their doctor or practice nurse and make an informed decision.</p> <p>Cancer scientists, however, have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/07/scientists-fear-pr-campaign-underplays-hrt-cancer-risks\">expressed concern</a> that the effect of the guideline might be to rehabilitate HRT without sufficient recognition of the long-term potential harm. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/10/leading-hrt-experts-not-consulted-over-nhs-menopause-guidance\">Prof Valerie Beral</a>, an Oxford epidemiologist who leads the Million Women study which linked HRT to breast and ovarian cancer, told the Guardian that the risks were clear.</p> <p>“About one million UK women are currently using hormones for the menopause,” she said. “Among them, about 10,000 extra breast cancers are estimated to occur in the next 10 years [40,000 in total, instead of 30,000 if the women had not used the hormones]. Also about 1,000 extra ovarian cancers are estimated to occur among them in the next 10 years [6,000 in total].”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/07/scientists-fear-pr-campaign-underplays-hrt-cancer-risks\">HRT media campaign underplays cancer risks, critics say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Nice guideline committee says that women should be able to make up their own minds as to whether the benefits of relieving menopause symptoms would outweigh any potential risks. GPs or practice nurses should explain the risks, taking into account a woman’s individual circumstances. For example, breast cancer risks rise for those who are overweight or drink regularly.</p> <p>“Women can cope with lots of side effects as long as they know about them,” said Prof Mary Ann Lumsden, chair of the committee. “The thing that really bothers them is if they haven’t been told.”<br /></p> <p>Dr Imogen Shaw, a GP with a special interest in gynaecology on the committee, said many women’s needs were not being met. “There are still a lot of women out there who have no idea there is any treatment.”</p> <p>Shaw said women have told her of having to get up twice in the night to change the sheets, which are soaked with sweat, and of setting off for work after a shower, having dried their hair, only to arrive with a wet scalp and make-up running down their face. “If this is interfering with your life and you are not coping with these symptoms, go and talk to your GP or a practice nurse,” she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/20/women-menopause-symptoms-hormone-therapy\">What women should know about menopause</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The guideline is the first on the menopause, which women go through at an average age of 51. An estimated 1.5 million women, around 80% of those experiencing the menopause, have some symptoms and 20% suffer more severely. One woman in 100 experiences a premature menopause before the age of 40. Those women would particularly benefit from hormonal therapy, Nice says. </p> <p>It advises that tests for hormone levels to establish whether women over 45 have reached the menopause should be discontinued as they are unreliable and a waste of money. It says women who have had breast cancer and have menopausal symptoms should be referred to a specialist to see what treatment is suitable for them.</p> <p>According to Nice, there are treatments other than HRT than can alleviate some, but not all, of the symptoms. These include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/15/cognitive-behaviour-therapy-menopause-symptoms\">cognitive behaviour therapy </a>(CBT) for low mood. The guideline says antidepressants should not be given unless a woman has a diagnosis of depression. There is some evidence that alternative therapies such as black cohosh and St John’s wort can help with some symptoms, but they warn that they do not come in standard preparations and that they can interact with other medicines. </p> <p>The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (MHRA), which licenses drugs in the UK, recommends that the lowest effective dose of HRT should be given to women for the shortest possible time – advice Nice repeats.<br /></p> <p>Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard, spokesperson for the Royal College of GPs, said the guideline would be very helpful to health professionals. “Many women are understandably concerned about the link that has been made between HRT and increased risk of breast cancer and other conditions, such as thromboembolism,” she said. “But it is important to remember that these issues are closely related to prolonged use of HRT in older women and these risks reduce substantially after treatment is stopped.</p> <p>“Ultimately, any decision to prescribe HRT needs to come out of a discussion between GPs and individual patients about their unique circumstances, the pros and cons of treatments, and how to achieve the best possible health outcome.”</p> <p>Dr Claire Knight, Cancer Research UK’s health information manager, said: “We know that using hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of developing breast, ovarian and in some cases womb cancer, but HRT can also offer effective relief from menopausal symptoms. </p> <p>“What these new guidelines from Nice reiterate is that there are many factors at play in a woman’s choice to use HRT or not and women need clear, evidence-based information around the risks and benefits to help them make an informed decision. If you are considering starting or stopping HRT, speak with your doctor.”<br

It was pretty scary, it was talked about the whole day and it kept getting worse and worse.”<br /></p> <p>Another student, who asked not to be named, said several students collapsed in the school hall. She said: “When the first boy was sick, we thought it was a one-off but then there was a big slap on the floor and someone had fainted. After that it was a bit of a domino effect, another three or four collapsed and then people started leaving the hall to get fresh air. One of the boys who fell was a bit concussed and had a big lump on his head. After that they ushered us out quickly and a couple of girls had panic attacks.”</p> <p> Rumours of a gas leak were posted on a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/BlowyourhornRipon/\">Facebook forum for parents at the school</a>, but Dave Winspear, from North Yorkshire fire service, said specialists detected no hazardous substances.</p> <p>He said: “Children were feeling unwell, nauseous, dizzy. The ambulance service treated children for those symptoms. We worked through our protocol to see if there was anything untoward and assessed the school for any hazardous materials.”<br /></p> <p>While the cause remained unknown, Winspear said the assembly hall was warm at the time. He added: “We are of the view the children just fainted and there was a ripple effect throughout the school. More children felt anxiety and started to feel concerned and the thing has escalated. </p> <p>“I would like to assure you, we have carried out a very thorough assessment and found no hazardous materials or anything untoward in the school environment.” <br /></p> <p>A spokeswoman for <a href=\"http://www.outwood.com/\">Outwood Grange academies trust</a>, which runs the school, said four students fainted during assembly, one of whom bumped their head. “Following the assembly, a further 20 students presented themselves during the course of the morning complaining of feeling faint and dizzy. At this point the academy, again as a precaution, called an ambulance.”</p> <p>In all, the trust said, 40 students were treated on site. All later rejoined lessons or went home as normal.</p> <p>Yorkshire ambulance service said it received a call at about 11.30am reporting that a number of students had “fallen ill suddenly with nausea and feeling faint”.</p> <p>It said: “We dispatched a number of resources to the scene including a doctor, three ambulance crews, two rapid response vehicles, a number of clinical supervisors and our hazardous area response team.”</p> <p>Incidents of sudden mass illness and fainting are not unknown at schools or other big gatherings of young people. The most famous such event took place in 1980 when almost 300 children taking part in an outdoor brass band competition in Nottinghamshire suddenly suffered vomiting and other symptoms.</p> <p>The cause was never pinpointed, with some officials suggesting at the time that it could have been mass hysteria. However, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/3128402.stm\">a later BBC investigation said</a> a subsequently banned pesticide had been sprayed in nearby fields and could have caused the illness.</p> <p>• A news alert sent for this story stated that 27 students had been taken to hospital. Later information from police clarified that two were taken to hospital and others treated at the scene.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971733","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405324","internalRevision":"1187","internalContentCode":"458368803","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Fire crews believe several students collapsing at Outwood academy, North Yorkshire, caused ‘ripple effect’ of nausea and faintness <br>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Ripple of anxiety-based nausea affects 40 pupils at Ripon school","byline":"Peter Walker and Chloe Coleman","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T13:59:16Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c5156e3d75af66c122e33f9562ad0486ce0307e5/124_88_2892_1736/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"564347e7e4b0d32696a38f91","newspaperPageNumber":"4","standfirst":"<p>Fire crews believe several students collapsing at Outwood academy, North Yorkshire, caused ‘ripple effect’ of nausea and faintness <br></p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T13:51:35Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T17:01:11.208Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/11/pupils-collapse-school-ripon-south-yorkshire","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2015/nov/11/pupils-collapse-school-ripon-south-yorkshire","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"gu-video-5643a19be4b05f01ec0a2dd6","relation":"main","type":"video","assets":[{"type":"video","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/11/151111obama_KP-25933026.m3u8","typeData":{"source":"ITN","embeddable":"false","blockAds":"false","mediaId":"gu-video-5643a19be4b05f01ec0a2dd6","durationMinutes":"1","durationSeconds":"37","caption":"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/nov/11/confusion-in-ripon-after-several-pupils-collapse-in-school-assembly-video\">Confusion in Ripon after several pupils collapse in school assembly </a>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e5z5"},"mimeType":"video/m3u8"},{"type":"video","file":"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10942397&format=video/webm","typeData":{"source":"ITN","embeddable":"false","blockAds":"false","mediaId":"gu-video-5643a19be4b05f01ec0a2dd6","durationMinutes":"1","durationSeconds":"37","caption":"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/nov/11/confusion-in-ripon-after-several-pupils-collapse-in-school-assembly-video\">Confusion in Ripon after several pupils collapse in school assembly </a>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e5z5"},"mimeType":"video/webm"},{"type":"video","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/11/151111rippon2_desk.mp4","typeData":{"source":"ITN","embeddable":"false","blockAds":"false","mediaId":"gu-video-5643a19be4b05f01ec0a2dd6","durationMinutes":"1","durationSeconds":"37","caption":"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/nov/11/confusion-in-ripon-after-several-pupils-collapse-in-school-assembly-video\">Confusion in Ripon after several pupils collapse in school assembly </a>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e5z5"},"mimeType":"video/mp4"},{"type":"video","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/11/151111rippon2_small.3gp","typeData":{"source":"ITN","embeddable":"false","blockAds":"false","mediaId":"gu-video-5643a19be4b05f01ec0a2dd6","durationMinutes":"1","durationSeconds":"37","caption":"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/nov/11/confusion-in-ripon-after-several-pupils-collapse-in-school-assembly-video\">Confusion in Ripon after several pupils collapse in school assembly </a>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e5z5"},"mimeType":"video/3gp:small"},{"type":"video","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/11/151111rippon2_large.3gp","typeData":{"source":"ITN","embeddable":"false","blockAds":"false","mediaId":"gu-video-5643a19be4b05f01ec0a2dd6","durationMinutes":"1","durationSeconds":"37","caption":"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/nov/11/confusion-in-ripon-after-several-pupils-collapse-in-school-assembly-video\">Confusion in Ripon after several pupils collapse in school assembly </a>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e5z5"},"mimeType":"video/3gp:large"},{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/ec5a30a7ac69578e540d0a8fbb0ab96fa20fa094/0_0_3500_1968/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaId":"gu-video-5643a19be4b05f01ec0a2dd6","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5a30a7ac69578e540d0a8fbb0ab96fa20fa094/0_0_3500_1968/2000.jpg","width":"2000","height":"1125","source":"Reuters","photographer":"Craig Brough","caption":"Police officers stand outside Outwood Academy as emergency services attend to an incident at the school, in Ripon, North Yorkshire, in England, November 11, 2015.

menopause?</h2> <p>They include hot flushes, where women suddenly experience a wave of heat and their skin can flush red, night sweats, insomnia, tiredness, mood swings and vaginal dryness, which can affect desire for sex. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\"

naturally made hormones, particularly oestrogen, as a result of her ovaries ceasing to produce eggs.</p> <h2>When does the menopause occur?</h2> <p>At an average age of 51, but it is variable and some women experience a premature menopause in their 40s and 1 in 100 go through it even earlier. Some suffer it early as a result of cancer treatment.</p> <h2>What is HRT?</h2> <p>Hormone replacement therapy is literally that – giving women artificially made hormones in the form of pills or patches. </p> <h2>Which hormones are women given?</h2> <p>Oestrogen replacement effectively ends the symptoms. But if given on its own, it increases the risk that women will get cancer of the womb, so those who have not had a hysterectomy are given progestogen as well, which is protective. </p> <h2>Does HRT have any other benefits? </h2> <p>It helps prevent thinning bones, which is a problem as women go through menopause and get older, and lessens the risk of fractures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/10/leading-hrt-experts-not-consulted-over-nhs-menopause-guidance\">Leading HRT experts not consulted over NHS menopause guidance</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How many women have taken HRT?</h2> <p>More than 100 million women worldwide.</p> <h2>In the UK?</h2> <p>Two million women were thought to be on it before studies revealed cancer risks. The numbers then halved.</p> <h2>What are the risks?</h2> <p>HRT is responsible for about five breast cancers per 1,000 women taking it for five years, studies have shown. The risk is low for women taking oestrogen only. When women stop taking the drugs, their risk returns to normal over about five years. HRT is also linked to one case of ovarian cancer per 1,000 women taking it for five years from the age of 50. There is also a very small increased risk of stroke.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971166","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2404728","internalRevision":"1117","internalContentCode":"458364108","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"What is it and how does it affect women?

The remarkable appearance of the <a href=\"http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/species.php?species=boeticus\">long-tailed blue</a>, a butterfly happiest in the heat of Africa or Australia, raises a mystery: will these insects simply die this winter?</p> <p>Until recently, the long-tailed blue, or <em>Lampides boeticus,</em> very occasionally arrived in hot summers: notably in 1945, and 1990 when it pitched up in Gillespie Park, north London. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/29/long-tailed-blue-butterfly-dover\">In 2013</a>, however, there was an unprecedented invasion. Summer arrivals laid eggs on everlasting peas (ironically a garden plant gone wild, imported from Italy) and in October offspring emerged: 109 were counted. <a href=\"http://butterfly-conservation.org/48-10378/mediterranean-blue-butterfly-invades-south-coast.html\">This year</a> it’s happened again. But the emergence of a British born generation has been delayed by the gloomy autumn. If it stays mild and the rain stops, more could yet hatch.</p> <p>Why this sudden influx? Neil Hulme, of Butterfly Conservation, says: “My suspicion is its zone of permanent residency has moved northwards through Europe because of climate change and we are now in strikingdistance.” He believes this dynamic little flyer (it ascends into the Himalayas) will become a regular migrant, like the painted lady.</p> <p>For 45 years, he says, he never saw a long-tailed blue, and now he’s seen 50 in three summers. “It’s unthinkable that one person could have seen 50 long-tailed blues in Britain five years ago.”</p> <p>But is Britain a dead end? Do the long-tailed blue’s offspring perish in winter?</p> <p>Hulme is convinced that British born long-tailed blues make a reverse migration, just like other migratory butterflies – heading south through Europe to escape our fatal frosts. “The evidence is circumstantial but it’s overwhelmingly in favour of their migrating back south, like painted ladies do.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10970315","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405548","internalRevision":"86","internalContentCode":"458370974","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Patrick Barkham on how the long-tailed blue’s geographic zone has moved north putting England now within in striking distance","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Climate shift ushers in subtropical butterfly","byline":"Patrick Barkham","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T21:30:01Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/6b07f95e5340e9c679025409e3c2b3db95758221/543_470_4663_2799/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56437e17e4b04096fed8b50e","newspaperPageNumber":"48","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-14T21:30:01Z","creationDate":"2015-11-11T17:42:47Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T22:00:41.333Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/11/butterfly-watch-barkham-subtropical-long-tailed-blue-england-","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/11/butterfly-watch-barkham-subtropical-long-tailed-blue-england-","sectionName":"Environment","elements":[{"id":"6b07f95e5340e9c679025409e3c2b3db95758221","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/6b07f95e5340e9c679025409e3c2b3db95758221/543_470_4663_2799/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2005 Rex Features.

Their trade in Europe is estimated to be worth millions of euros.</p> <p>At the September trade fair, the Guardian posed as a potential buyer and was offered earless monitor lizards and arboreal alligator lizards, both of which are protected species in their home countries of Indonesia and Mexico and Guatemala respectively. The next fair is on 12 December.</p> <p>“The trading of nationally protected species may only be a small part of the reptile business, but it could easily drive highly threatened species to extinction,” said Sandra Altherr, the co-founder of Pro Wildlife, a German conservation group. “Some of these creatures have already been confined to tiny areas of territory in their native lands.”</p> <p> The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) will hear <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/ac/28/E-AC28-22-04.pdf\">proposals to ban the international trade</a> in earless monitor and some arboreal alligator lizards at its next conference in South Africa in 2016. </p> <p>In the meantime, while collecting the species in the wild and exporting them is illegal in their countries of origin, they may be freely bought and sold in Europe without a crime being committed - and no extradition treaties apply.</p> <p></p> <p>Nonetheless, the trade in endangered species at Hamm goes on at the fringes of the main fair. The Terraristika organisers ban photography, so it is hard for anyone not there to know which species are changing hands.</p> <p>The cavernous warehouse into which Hamm welcomes thousands of visitors is itself an exotic territory. Teenagers, travellers, anarchists and alternative pet shop owners roam the huge convention site, which is filled with stalls containing many thousands of often venomous snakes, frogs, lizards and spiders.</p> <p>Some visitors carry large white boxes under their arms. Others sport “recovering reptaholic” t-shirts that are equal parts spiv and goth - a bit like Only Fools and Horses with face tattoos.</p> <p>“<em>Lanthanotus borneensis</em>? I know a friend who has them,” said stallholder Jurgen Schmidt, referring to the Latin name for the earless monitor lizard. “They’re about €5,000 a pair, captive bred, about this size,” he said, holding out his fingers about 20 centimetres. “I can call him and ask if he’s here?”</p> <p>Another trader that operates at the Hamm fairs is Robert Seipp, a German teacher, keeper and trader of reptiles which, according to his Facebook page, include the prized Borneo lizard.</p> <p>In 1993, Seipp was the only member of a group of four German lizard enthusiasts to emerge unscathed from a gun battle with Madagascan authorities, that left two of his party dead, and a third blind in one eye. One Malagasy police officer was also killed, reportedly shot by accident by another cop. </p> <p>Two of Seipp’s employees have been <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10724047\">prosecuted and jailed in New Zealand</a> for taking rare gecko species from the wild, according to a letter from the government’s conservation department to Pro Wildlife, which the Guardian has seen. It said that Seipp had not visited the country and he was not prosecuted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dcbc6e9b364e0534f145d43da895993157019c1\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/5dcbc6e9b364e0534f145d43da895993157019c1/0_0_1534_920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photos of the lizards that they say Schaub was selling on his stall at the Terraristika fair in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photos of the lizards that they say Schaub was selling on his stall at the Terraristika fair in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private colletion</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It would be an understatement [to say] that we remain concerned for any continuing smuggling of any and all of our protected wildlife (flora and fauna),” Geoff Owen, the department’s Cites enforcement manager wrote. Jewelled gecko populations had declined by 95% in a 15-year period, he said.</p> <p>Owen said there is a growing problem with desirable species being smuggled out of the country by dealers and collectors: “New Zealand has taken a number of prosecutions against what has been a disproportionate number of German nationals for attempting to take protected geckos from New Zealand. The number of events has noticeably grown in recent years.”</p> <p>Sources with knowledge of the Hamm fair say that Seipp and another German trader, Markus Schaub, bought and sold jewelled geckos at the Terraristika trade fair in June. Selling them in Europe is not illegal but taking them from New Zealand would be. Seipp did not respond to a request for comment. Schaub, who says that he is a conservationist, denies that he sold the species. </p> <p>At the trade fair, Schaub, was eager to talk when asked if he had any rare <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abronia_(lizard)\">abronias</a> (arboreal alligator lizards). “You’re looking to buy?” he said. “I have abronias here, but only that I got from one customer to ship to another. I just do the transport.” </p> <p>Schaub handed over a business card with an email address for his partner, Maciej Oskroba, and said: “If you’re interested, just write me an email so I can let you know if people are offering abronias. I have customers calling me, saying ‘Markus, I’ve got a <em>deppii’</em> and I’m expecting a <em>fimbriata </em>[two species of abronia]<em>.</em>”</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/costa-rica/140917/costa-rican-wildlife-trafficking-takeout-containers\">Oskroba was</a> caught trying to smuggle more than 400 frogs, lizards and snakes out of Costa Rice last year. He was held for a few days then deported. “In my 20 years working at the airport, this is the largest wildlife trafficking case we’ve seen,” Carlos Viquez, the chief of Panama airport security <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/costa-rica/140917/costa-rican-wildlife-trafficking-takeout-containers\">was quoted as saying at the time</a>. </p> <p>In reply to an emailed request ostensibly from an enthusiast interested in purchasing rare lizards, Oskroba wrote: “I will let you know in a few weeks how it should works [sic] on abronias. Please wait a bit for further information.” </p> <p>Schaub and Schmidt both denied that the reptiles they were offering had been caught in the wild.</p> <p>But captive breeding is not possible for all species. International experts believe that rare species such as earless monitor lizards could not be captive-bred for sale in trade fairs. “All the specimens available outside Borneo have been illegally obtained and brought there,” said Mark Auliya, the co-chair of the IUCN’s monitor lizard specialist group. “For the people who harvest and collect lizards, it’s like additional pocket money. The main money is made by syndicates of importers and exporters – the profit margin is extremely high,” he added.<em> </em></p> <p>The more rare and exotic the species, the higher the asking price. The IUCN says that one contemporary trend for “mutants” has created bizarrely multicoloured frogs and snakes without scalation that bleed if they try to move on a rough surface. </p> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earless_monitor_lizard\"><em>Lanthanotus borneensis</em></a> is a truly enigmatic, subterranean species that is sought by collectors for its unique features such as blue eyes and a lack of visible ears. Campaigners and vendors both say that a drop in their retail price from €8,000 a pair at the start of the year to €5,000 in September suggests an increase in supply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8413d133ffaededb85f37866aed6119808edd77\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c8413d133ffaededb85f37866aed6119808edd77/0_142_4288_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An earless monitor lizard pair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An earless monitor lizard pair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthijs Kuijpers/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Those animals were like the holy grail for many years because no one believed they really existed,” one seller said. “Now that Borneo is destroying the habitats where they lived for palm oil plantations, you can find them in the rice fields, in every channel where water flows between one field and another. At first they were expensive but no one is bringing them in anymore. It’s cheaper to breed them here.” </p> <p>But the argument that lizard traders are protecting animals threatened by habitat loss in the wild was “complete nonsense,” said the IUCN’s Mark Auliya, who is currently based at the Helmholtz centre for environmental research in Leipzig.</p> <p>Pro Wildlife’s Sandra Altherr agreed: “Preservation in captivity would only make sense if the smugglers planned to release these animals into the wild one day and of course, they do not.”</p> <p>In private, traders admit that the rearing of lizards for sale is not always played by the book. “Taking species from the wild is frowned upon nowadays. It’s all about captive breeding but you have to have new blood to liven up the gene pool,” explained one London-based reptile seller.</p> <p>Another trader compared the reptile industry to stamp collecting. “We’re all aware that there are animals coming to Europe from sources that are working on the grey line,” he said. “We have a big problem in that you can trade Cites species without any controls, just a hand-written note saying ‘I’m a breeder and I sold you an animal’.” </p> <p>The Guardian approached the organisers of the Terraristika trade fair but they declined to comment. </p> <h2>LUCRATIVE LIZARDS</h2> <p>Reptiles are not the most charismatic of protected species, but they can play a vital role in ecosystems. Herbivorous species can be important seed dispersers, especially on islands and other lizards may eat rodents and insect pests. Reptiles can also act as pollinators for rare plants. In food chains, lizards play a role as predators and prey, and their removal can severely impact upon other wildlife populations, and ecosystems in general. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36fa68935a71a4e4ffd8c365327e13bacc6d1113\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/36fa68935a71a4e4ffd8c365327e13bacc6d1113/0_303_5315_3190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rhino-horned lizard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rhino horn lizard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Ceratophora stoddartii</em>: <strong>Rhino horn lizard</strong></p> <p>This slow-moving arboreal lizard has bright orange lining inside its mouth that it reveals when threatened.

This is a part of India that rarely appears on the itinerary of visiting dignitaries, in travel documentaries, or in gentle films featuring quirky run-down hotels, railways and monsoon rains.</p> <p>Yet one man who has paid significant attention to places like Kalkaji is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/narendra-modi\">Narendra Modi</a>, India’s prime minister. Without support from the inhabitants of such nondescript neighbourhoods, the 65-year-old would not have been able to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/16/narenda-modi-bjp-sweep-power-indian-elections\">win power in a landslide election result in May 2014</a>, crushing the centre-left Congress party.</p> <p>Modi arrives in London on Wednesday on the latest leg of what is turning into an 18-month world tour interspersed with frantic bursts of policymaking and campaigning in his homeland. The son of a tea seller from the western state of Gujarat will address parliament, meet David Cameron, talk with business leaders and have lunch with the Queen. </p> <p>He will also address a rally in Wembley stadium on Friday attended by supporters from among Britain’s <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_290558.pdf\">1.5 million-strong</a> Indian-origin community. If it follows previous precedent on both coasts of the US, the rally will be a stunning celebration of Indian identity and influence. There will be a Bollywood-influenced mix of dance, displays and speeches, rounded off with fireworks. Modi’s speech will be a familiar masala of nationalism, his own brand of economics and appeals to his audience’s cultural roots.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">Paris climate change conference</a> opening within weeks, India’s “traditional” attachment to sustainable development may get a mention, as will the desire of Modi, an ascetic yoga devotee, to clean up the sacred but heavily polluted river Ganges. In New York he sought diaspora donations for the project.</p> <p>It is likely he will also talk of India’s diversity. “It will be about all the wonderful things he will do for India … and there will be a little bit about pluralism perhaps,” said Shekhar Gupta, an Indian journalist and analyst.</p> <p> This is more controversial ground. In recent months India’s image overseas has been battered by a series of incidents of sectarian violence. One of the worst was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/inside-bishari-indian-village-where-mob-killed-man-for-eating-beef\">the lynching of a Muslim man</a> who was suspected of eating beef by a Hindu mob in a village on the outskirts of Delhi. Cows are sacred to Hindus and killing or selling their meat is illegal in most parts of India.</p> <p>Some criticise Modi, a Hindu nationalist, for failing to condemn such attacks clearly and quickly. Among critics are writers, intellectuals and film-makers who have launched a series of protests against what they say is a “climate of intolerance”.</p> <p>Last week Arundhati Roy, the prize-winning author and activist, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/05/arundhati-roy-returns-award-protest-religious-intolerance-india-bollywood-modi-government-violence\">added her voice</a>, saying minorities in India were “being forced to live in terror, unsure of when and from where the assault will come.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/06/returning-award-ashamed-india-arundhati-roy\">I am returning my award because I’m ashamed of what’s happening in India | Arundhati Roy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Officials from the ruling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/16/narenda-modi-bjp-sweep-power-indian-elections\">Bharatiya Janata party (BJP)</a> have dismissed the protests as politically motivated and manufactured. But whether such sentiments are as divorced from mainstream popular opinion as they believe is unclear. </p> <p>An outsider who started his career with India’s biggest rightwing Hindu revivalist organisation, Modi promised his compatriots a new, more prosperous, meritocratic and muscular India that neighbours would fear and respect, all without allowing western influence on conservative cultural and social values. It was a powerful vision that resonated with the newly expanded urban middle classes in Kalkaji and a multitude of scruffy suburbs like it. </p> <p>Modi’s own backstory – the poor man made good – also struck a chord. “There may have been an assumption that he was strong on these Hindu values because of his background, but what was really refreshing to voters was the emphasis on the economy, the opportunities for youth and business-friendly government,” said Samir Saran, of the Observer Research Foundation, a Delhi thinktank.</p> <p>Though India’s GDP growth rates are among the highest in the world, flagship tax reform legislation is stuck in parliament, investment in infrastructure remains as inadequate as ever, the promised economic take-off has been elusive and high-profile initiatives enjoining the population to sweep up the rubbish that fouls cities and fields alike have made little difference.</p> <p>If overseas investment analysts are worried, most people in Kalkaji are not. “Change is happening very slowly [here] because it is a big country. It takes time,” said Vijay Kumar, 57, a property dealer in the neighbourhood. “Modi’s performance is excellent. He’s a hardworking PM. Have you ever heard about him taking leave from work? He’s always working for India’s future.”</p> <p>Others were less impressed. “I expected him to keep a check on inflation. This affects the middle class the most, yet he has done nothing ,” said Poonam Sharma, who works in a local import-export company.</p> <p>Opinion in Kalkaji appeared divided on the issue of sectarian violence. “Yes. It has hurt his image. People think that he is working for Hindus only, but that’s not the case, he will help Muslims, too,” said Deepak Sharma, 25, an ATM service engineer.</p> <p> Kumar, the property dealer, blamed Modi’s subordinates for “making irresponsible statements and getting him into trouble”. </p> <p>Kalkaji is a predominantly Hindu neighbourhood. In Nizamuddin, a largely Muslim community nearer the centre of Delhi, views of Modi were overwhelmingly negative.</p> <p>Results in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/08/narendra-modis-party-concedes-defeat-in-bihar-election\">election in the populous and poor eastern state of Bihar</a>, released on Sunday, revealed the potential impact of sectarian tension on Modi’s drive to reform India. During the bitter campaign, election authorities criticised the BJP for advertisements “of an offending nature” and banned several party posters they said could incite hatred.</p> <p>The party lost the election, despite Modi personally addressing 30 rallies. The defeat was the BJP’s <a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/9HTFGjs8NXpc9A0kQtXPyN/Bihar-election-results-The-buck-stops-with-the-ModiShah-du.html\">most significant domestic setback</a> since taking power. </p> <p>“Modi needs to reflect on whether his mandate was for better governance and economic opportunism – that he still needs to deliver – or for a kind of communal agenda … Hindus are not used to this kind of aggressive form of propagation and find it distasteful,” said Saran, the analyst.</p> <p>Modi is still the most popular politician in the country and, as is likely to be shown by the welcome in Wembley, among the Indian diaspora. Few have much confidence in Rahul Gandhi, the lacklustre scion of India’s premier political family, who fronts the Congress. </p> <p>However, expectations for Modi remain high. “Yes, he’s the best leader in India. But let’s see what he does going forward,” said Prem Prakash, 35, an employee in an export company in Delhi.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Nikhil

said the government will “obey” the results of the election and work to transfer power peacefully, after offering congratulations to the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi for what promises to be a landslide win for her party.</p> <p>“We will respect and obey the decision of the electorate,” Ye Htut, also the minister of information, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ye.htut.988\">said on his Facebook page</a>. “We will work peacefully in the transfer [of power]” he said. “Congratulations … to the chairperson Aung San Suu Kyi and her party for gathering the support of the people.”</p> <p>Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s powerful army chief, went further, congratulating Aung San Suu Kyi for winning a majority of seats. </p> <p>Although less than 50% of Sunday’s election results have been officially announced, the declarations are the clearest signal yet from the administration that it will support the first credibly elected government in more than half a century.<br /></p> <p>The National League for Democracy (NLD) party has taken around 90% of seats declared so far, with Aung San Suu Kyi claiming her own constituency on Wednesday.</p> <p>In the wake of her win, Aung San Suu Kyi has written to Min Aung Hlaing, the president, Thein Sein, and the parliamentary Speaker, Shwe Mann, requesting a meeting to discuss the election and “national reconciliation”, according to the National League for Democracy Facebook page.</p> <p>Ye Htut <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/myanmarpresidentoffice.gov.mm/photos/a.813483202032751.1073741828.813476528700085/922202267827510/?type=3\">posted a photograph of the four leaders</a> on Facebook on Wednesday, a nod of acceptance towards Aung San Suu Kyi’s request. But he said the meeting would take place only after all the election results had been announced. </p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi is blocked by the Myanmar constitution from becoming president but said last week that she intended to be “above the president” if her party won sufficient seats. She said on Tuesday that the president would “have no authority” and “will act in accordance with the decisions of the party” – an audacious statement seen as antagonistic towards the military. The placatory tone from the president’s spokesman on Wednesday will calm fears of a backlash.</p> <p>The meeting, when it takes place, will be the start of what is expected to be months of political negotiations in Myanmar as to how power is shared with the longstanding military elite.</p> <p>“The citizens have expressed their will in the election,” Aung San Suu Kyi said in her invitation to talks. “I would like to invite you to discuss reconciliation next week at a time of your convenience.”</p> <p>The government’s Union Election Commission has released results in 10 stages over the three days since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/08/aung-san-suu-kyi-casts-vote-in-myanmars-first-free-election-for-25-years\">polling on Sunday</a>, all of which have shown the NLD beating the incumbent Union Solidarity and Development party (USDP) by wide margins. </p> <p>Wednesday’s results also revealed the NLD had made gains across diverse areas of the country, despite earlier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/06/myanmar-human-rights-democracy-aung-san-suu-kyi\">speculation</a> that many from Myanmar’s 40% ethnic minority populations would vote for smaller parties, hampering the NLD’s chances of a majority.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rshorsey\">Richard Horsey</a>, an independent political analyst, said: “The really big surprise in these results wasn’t the drubbing that the USDP got, or the NLD landslide, it was the massive defeat suffered by most ethnic minority parties.” </p> <p>He said the defeat could blunt the voices of the nation’s minorities. “For a country still emerging from six decades of civil war, it is a big concern if the parliament fails to reflect the diversity of the country.”</p> <p>There are 168 contested seats in the upper house of parliament and 330 in the lower house, although seven of those lower house seats were cancelled due to fighting with insurgent groups in border areas.</p> <p>That amounts to a total of 491 seats to be contested in both houses, not including the 25% of seats that are automatically reserved for the army. Therefore, the NLD needs to win 67%, or 329 seats across the two houses, to gain a majority.</p> <p>Less than half the results have been announced in a painstakingly drawn-out process, with the NLD winning 258 seats across both houses of parliament, the USDP 21 and other parties 23. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won her seat in Kawmhu, Yangon, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/10/myanmar-election-aung-san-suu-kyi-on-track-to-take-two-thirds-of-seats\">said on Tuesday</a> that her party had won 75% of contested seats. A senior NLD figure <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/10/myanmar-election-aung-san-suu-kyi-on-track-to-take-two-thirds-of-seats\">later told the Guardian</a> that unofficial party results showed it had won 82% of contested seats.</p> <p>The gains were so strong that a regional parliamentary candidate for the NLD won against the ruling party’s runner despite having died two days before the election while <a href=\"http://www.frontiermyanmar.net/en/opposition-candidate-dies-suddenly-campaign-trail\">delivering</a> a campaign speech.</p> <p>Leading ruling party figures such as <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/759ef44c-4196-11e5-9abe-5b335da3a90e.htmlaxzz3r38Hj4Au\">Shwe Mann</a> and Htay Oo, the acting party chairman, have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/09/myanmar-elections-aung-san-suu-kyi-hints-at-victory#block-56404c9be4b05e53c04d4f6a\">already conceded defeat</a> in their constituencies.</p> <p>The European Union mission observing the elections said the polls were well run, with monitoring teams around the country reporting an overwhelmingly positive message about the conduct of the contest.The chief observer Alexander Graf Lambsdorff said international observers around the country had “reported very positively on the voting … with 95% rating the process a ‘good’ or ‘very good’”.</p> <p>However, while the USDP has been diminished and much of the decades-old establishment shaken by the extent of Aung San Suu Kyi’s victory, the army retains power.</p> <p>In addition to its guaranteed bloc of parliamentary seats, the commander-in-chief nominates the heads of three powerful and big-budget ministries – interior, defence and border security – and the constitution also gives him the right to take over the government under certain circumstances.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971224","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405222","internalRevision":"554","internalContentCode":"458367967","publication":"The

Zealanders held on Christmas Island so angry they may riot – Labour MP</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The women’s intervention came after prime minister John Key on Tuesday accused opposition Labour and Green MPs of “backing the rapists” in a row over the detention of New Zealanders by the Australian government.</p> <p>Opposition politicians had raised concerns in parliament over the detention of New Zealand citizens awaiting deportation after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/17/new-zealand-mp-says-deportations-make-a-mockery-of-anzac-relationship\">Canberra government cancelled visas</a> for those convicted of certain crimes.</p> <p>Key went on a tirade after being questioned by Labour leader Andrew Little, telling Little “you back the rapists”, before being cut off by the Speaker, David Carter.<br /></p> <p>“Some of the [detainees] are rapists, some of them are child molesters, and some of them are murderers,” Key said.</p> <p>“These are the people that the Labour party are saying are more important to support than New Zealanders who deserve protecting when they come back here.”</p> <p>Key told Labour MP Kelvin Davis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/17/new-zealand-mp-says-deportations-make-a-mockery-of-anzac-relationship\">who has said</a> the detentions make a <br />mockery” of the Anzac relationship: “If you want to put yourself on the side of sex offenders, go ahead my son, but we’ll defend New Zealanders.”</p> <p>An estimated three-quarters of Labour MPs walked out of parliament directly after Key’s comments on Tuesday, along with several Green members.</p> <p>Key told the house and New Zealand media that he stood by his comments.</p> <p>A number of New Zealanders are being detained <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/10/australian-government-says-christmas-island-is-calm-after-riots\">on Christmas Island</a> after the Australian government introduced a retroactive law requiring the deportation of overseas citizens convicted of crimes carrying a custodial sentence of more than a year. Some New Zealanders affected by the change have lived in Australia for several years and are appealing the decision to deport them.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Green party co-leader Metiria Turei told the Speaker that as a survivor of sexual violence she was deeply offended by Key’s remarks: “As the victim of a sexual assault, I take personal offence at the prime minister’s comments, and ask that you require him to withdraw and apologise.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/11/new-zealand-prime-minister-john-key-tells-opposition-you-back-rapists-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4e5xh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2405015\"            data-video-name=\"New Zealand prime minister John Key tells opposition: ‘You back rapists’ – video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian AustraliaGuardian Australia\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5642e054e4b0ddf11c1fbf23\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/11/151111NZJohnKey_FromGAus-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/11/151111NZJohnKey_FromGAus/151111NZJohnKey_FromGAus.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/11/151111NZJohnKey_FromGAus_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/11/151111NZJohnKey_FromGAus_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/11/11/151111NZJohnKey_FromGAus.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/11/new-zealand-prime-minister-john-key-tells-opposition-you-back-rapists-video\">New Zealand prime minister John Key tells opposition: ‘You back rapists’ </a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Her comments were echoed by Green MP Catherine Delahunty, who was told by the Speaker to stop and sit back down.</p> <p>When other female MPS, including Labour’s Nanaia Mahuta, Clare Curran and Megan Woods, along with Green MP Marama Davidson repeated the call for Key to apologise with reference to their own assaults, Carter ordered them to stop, saying they were “flouting the rules” by claiming to make points of order.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p>Carter said he had not heard Key’s comments clearly at the time and it was too late to demand an apology.</p> <p>Despite the warning, MPs continued to stand to urge the Speaker to take action.</p> <p>Green MP Marama Davidson was then thrown out of the House, followed by Poto Williams. At least eight others then chose to leave the debating chamber.<br /></p> <p>They were joined by four male MPs, including Greens co-leader James Shaw, and are demanding Key apologise for his comments. </p> <p>Delahunty said the MPs had walked out on behalf of women around New Zealand. “We’ve walked out because every woman in this country needs to know that women parliamentarians will not put up with this,” she said.</p> <p>“We will not stand by and allow this to be bandied around parliament – this kind of abuse of people and way of approaching rape is simply unacceptable, and the prime minister has to be held to account.”</p> <p>The MPs who walked out are being widely praised on social media and Wellington Rape Crisis said it supported the MPs’ action.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10970995","productionOffice":"AUS","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2404998","internalRevision":"724","internalContentCode":"458366302","publication":"The

On Tuesday, research by the Office for National Statistics showed that while 25% of people thought paying into a workplace pension scheme was likely to prove the best way to save for retirement, 44% thought property was likely to make the most of their cash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/buy_to_let-zip/giv-311149gTqWOhpc1a0\" data-alt=\"Graph showing number of buy-to-let loans for house purchases\"> <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/buy_to_let-zip/giv-311149gTqWOhpc1a0\">Graph showing number of buy-to-let loans for house purchases</a> <figcaption>Graph showing number of buy-to-let loans for house purchases</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The CML figures showed that 11,300 buy-to-let loans worth a combined £1.5bn were advanced in September, an increase of more than a third on the same month in 2014.</p> <p>The figure was down on the recent peak of 11,800 in July, but followed a strong August to bring the highest quarterly figure since before the credit crisis.</p> <p>The CML said that despite the strong growth, buy-to-let remained a minority of its members’ business. </p> <p>Paul Smee, director general of the CML, said:<strong> </strong>“Buy-to-let continues its growth this period but, at 18% of new lending in September, remains the fourth largest lending type behind first-time buyers, home movers and remortgages. </p> <p>“There were five times as many house purchase loans to homeowners as buy-to-let landlords in September, and the growth in buy-to-let lending largely continues to reflect its more belated recovery from recession.”</p> <p>During the downturn, buy-to-let lending declined more than lending to homeowners, as investing in property looked more risky to individuals and lenders. While loans to homeowners for house purchase declined by 50% in volume terms from 2007 to 2009, buy-to-let loans for house purchase declined 71% in the same period, the CML said. </p> <p>However, the market has turned up sharply and lenders are competing to offer the best deals to landlords. During the quarter, 37,400 loans were granted to investors who were remortgaging. </p> <p>In the emergency budget in July, the chancellor outlined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/osborne-buy-to-let-tax-relief-limit-budget\">changes that will remove some of the tax reliefs available to buyers</a>, and the Treasury is due to launch a consultation on whether the Bank of England should be given new powers to restrict this type of lending. But the latest figures suggest buy-to-let investors are undeterred.</p> <p>Rob Weaver, director of investments at property crowdfunding platform Property Partner, said UK investors have continued confidence in buy-to-let. </p> <p>“As an asset class, buy-to-let is also benefiting from the growing concern about the state of the global economy – it is seen as a safe port in a storm,” he said. </p> <p>“With the Bank of England once again dovish on interest rates, this will represent a further fillip for people turning to bricks and mortar as an investment.”</p> <p>The CML’s data also showed year-on-year rises in the number of first-time buyers and home movers taking out mortgages.</p> <p>First-time buyers took out 28,600 home loans in September, up 10% on the previous year and 2% on August’s figure; home movers took out 33,800, a 4% fall on August’s number, but up 15% on September 2014.</p> <p>Smee said: “The market was a slow starter this year, but this quarter shows it is now firmly on an upward trajectory. With competitive rates and high levels of product choice currently available, alongside generally improving economic conditions, we expect this to continue as we head into the new year.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971456","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405198","internalRevision":"801","internalContentCode":"458367805","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Lending to landlords peaked in the summer as 33,600 loans were taken out for property purchase<br>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Buy-to-let mortgages at highest level since 2007, says CML","byline":"Hilary Osborne","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T15:20:58Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f11e2dd892113a04e7602ad95de8e3bbd2a7b15a/0_178_4106_2465/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56432ae1e4b091514c06d57a","newspaperPageNumber":"36","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-14T15:15:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Lending to landlords peaked in the summer as 33,600 loans were taken out for property purchase<br></p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T11:47:45Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T22:01:17.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/11/buy-to-let-mortgages-cml-lending-landlords-loans","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/money/2015/nov/11/buy-to-let-mortgages-cml-lending-landlords-loans","sectionName":"Money","elements":[{"id":"f11e2dd892113a04e7602ad95de8e3bbd2a7b15a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f11e2dd892113a04e7602ad95de8e3bbd2a7b15a/0_178_4106_2465/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/f11e2dd892113a04e7602ad95de8e3bbd2a7b15a","suppliersReference":"MONEY_Move_065154.JPG","altText":"Home sold sign","caption":"Poor returns from savings accounts, coupled with rising prices and rents, have made property an increasingly appealing investment.

spite its face” if it slashes science spending and cuts investment grants in the comprehensive spending review this month, according to Chuka Umunna, the former Labour business spokesman.</p> <p>Speaking to manufacturing bosses in the Midlands on Wednesday, Umunna said Britain’s recovery would suffer a setback if the chancellor sought to make savings from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the grants that support productivity improvements and growth.</p> <p>Umunna, Labour MP for Streatham, said the BIS should be the engine room of the economy, supporting investment in infrastructure and innovative manufacturing processes needed to compete in the global economy.</p> <p>“I accept the need to reduce the debt and deficit – it is a waste to be spending over £30bn this year servicing our debts instead of investing it in people. But doing so by raiding growth-inducing budgets like that of the BIS – where for every pound you invest you get a multiple return in growth and tax receipts to the exchequer – is an utterly false economy,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/sep/14/five-years-reasons-angry-science-funding-budget-cuts\">Science is vital: five reasons to be angry about science funding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“So, as he puts the finishing touches to his comprehensive spending review, I say this to the chancellor: don’t cut off your nose to spite your face because it will be our economy which suffers.”</p> <p>The BIS, which has a resource budget of about £13bn, is under pressure to make savings of up to 40% over the next five years as part of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/09/spending-review-how-the-cuts-could-fall-at-government-departments\">spending review to be announced by George Osborne</a> on 25 November. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/shrinking-pains-the-size-and-functions-of-the-state-over-the-parliament-and-beyond/\">report by the Resolution Foundation</a> thinktank estimated that the department’s total spending would fall by 53% between 2010 and 2020 under austerity measures planned by the Treasury. </p> <p>The bulk of the savings in the BIS budget since 2010 were made from shifting the burden of university funding to students under the £9,000 a year loan scheme. In 2015-16, the last year of the current spending round, the department must find another £450m in cuts, with only £150m to come from the universities’ teaching grant.</p> <p>Umunna said: “In order to drive forward the different elements of industrial strategy I’ve outlined, you need a strong business department, which is a powerhouse and the engine room of government. But in the last parliament the BIS budget was cut by 32% and is projected to have been cut by 53% by end of this one.”</p> <p>In the run-up to the spending review, which covers 2016-20, the business secretary, Sajid Javid, commissioned the management consultants McKinsey to examine the impact of merging or slimming the various bodies used by the department to dispense funds, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/jul/27/in-defence-of-the-ref\">the higher education research councils</a>. </p> <p>But the level of savings needed to meet Treasury targets is expected to force Javid to make <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/sep/14/five-years-reasons-angry-science-funding-budget-cuts\">cuts to science grants</a> and possibly abolish the BIS and merging its responsibilities with the education department and the Treasury.</p> <p>The BIS is the brainchild of Peter Mandelson, who in 2009 merged the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform with the two-year old Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills.<br tabindex=\"-1\"

Therein lies both the party’s greatest strength and weakness. The Democrats have all but settled on Hillary Clinton as their presidential nominee. She has <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html\" title=\"\">led every poll</a> for the last year and all but two of those leads were in double figures. So Republicans know who they have to beat.</p> <p>The trouble is, at first sight, they don’t appear to be any closer to reaching a consensus on who they should pick to beat her than when the debates started. On Tuesday night there were eight candidates on show. Over the last year the Republican field has boasted <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html\" title=\"\">six different frontrunners</a>. For the past four months that has been either Donald Trump, the billionaire windbag for whom “<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bloviator\" title=\"\">bloviator</a>” might have been invented, or evangelical neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who recently claimed the pyramids were for grain storage and that the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/26/ben-carson/fact-checking-ben-carson-nazi-guns/\" title=\"\">Holocaust might have been prevented</a> were it not for gun control. Between them they are attracting half of all party support. Both candidacies should be taken seriously, not least because they deprive other candidates of oxygen and because of the direction in which they are dragging the debate.</p> <p>But despite their current high standing, recent history suggests neither is likely to become the nominee. In 2012, the party flirted <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-1452.html\" title=\"\">with every alternative going</a> – Herman Cain, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry – before settling for the most obvious and only plausible choice: Mitt Romney. In 2008, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-192.html\" title=\"\">Mike Huckabee</a> continued to draw substantial support even after John McCain’s nomination was a foregone conclusion. In both cases Republicans eventually chose the most electable candidate. But only after he had been so undermined and the party name so ostentatiously tarnished that the nominee was rendered unelectable.</p> <p>In terms of money, name recognition and organisational capacity the two most viable nominees are Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. After Mr Rubio’s impressive performance in the most recent debate, when Mr Bush was again underwhelming, he is fast becoming the favoured son. He’s convivial, empathic, young, Latino, the son of immigrants and the senator from the swing state of Florida – none of which can be said of Ms Clinton. The one thing Mr Rubio does not have going for him, so far, is the Republican base.</p> <p>Mr Rubio’s challenge – and Mr Bush’s, should his campaign revive – is twofold. First, how to rise to the top without incurring the collateral damage that so fatally undermined Messrs McCain and Romney. If Messrs Trump and Carson stumble, the Texas senator, Ted Cruz, who also did well in the debate, will be there to deliver broadsides in the name of an angry and disillusioned base. Second, how to stay top without being drawn too far to the right – particularly on immigration reform. As Messrs Trump and Cruz championed building a wall on the border and mass deportation of undocumented migrants, Mr Bush opined “they’re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign now when they hear” this. Within seconds, Ms Clinton’s press secretary tweeted “We actually are doing high-fives right now”.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/romney-us-presidential-elections-republicans\" title=\"\">biggest liability a Republican nominee will have</a> is the party that, albeit reluctantly, nominates him. Because by the time you’ve endured what it takes within the party to be a plausible nominee, you no longer have the air of a plausible presidential candidate.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10969750","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405575","internalRevision":"35","internalContentCode":"458371154","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> The primaries have become so bruising that even the successful candidate will emerge damaged","allowUgc":"false","headline":"The Guardian view on the Republicans: sabotaging their own presidential prospects","byline":"Editorial","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T19:49:40Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/11/1447266435506/CNBC-Republican-President-001.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5643873ae4b04096fed8b52d","newspaperPageNumber":"42","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-14T19:49:40Z","standfirst":"The primaries have become so bruising that even the successful candidate will emerge damaged","creationDate":"2015-11-11T18:21:46Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T22:01:13.006Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-republicans-sabotaging-their-own-presidential-prospects","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-republicans-sabotaging-their-own-presidential-prospects","sectionName":"Comment is free","elements":[{"id":"2bcfec26dacba7533880499b96a4c9c7f7c1af49","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/11/1447266440832/CNBC-Republican-President-005.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*57226204","suppliersReference":"5320577b","altText":"Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Donald Trump and Ben Carson","caption":"Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colorado, 28 October 2015.

But Sainsbury’s has pencilled in a £30m profit hit from price cutting over the next six months, on top of an £80m impact from reductions on meat, fruit and vegetables in the first half of its financial year.</p> <p>Price cuts contributed to an 18% slide in Sainsbury’s profit before tax and one-off items to £308m for the 28 weeks to 26 September. The figure is Sainsbury’s lowest first-half profit since 2010 and down from £375m reported a year earlier. </p> <p>However the performance was better than expected by City analysts, who had been forecasting a far larger fall in profits, to between £284m-£293m. Sainsbury’s said it had been able to cut costs more than expected, partly by reducing food waste.</p> <p>Sales at stores open for at least a year fell 1.6%, excluding petrol, as food sales fell nearly 1% and the retailer cut prices by nearly 2.5%. Coupe said<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/12/sainsburys-150m-price-cuts-slumps-first-half-loss-profits\"> the strategy he set out a year ago</a> was working.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/26/sainsburys-chief-attacks-sunday-trading-law-change\">Sainsbury's chief attacks proposal to change Sunday trading laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sainsbury’s has been cutting prices and improving product quality and customer service to stop customers defecting to the discounters. It has reduced the amount of sugar in its own-brand yoghurts and juices and launched a £10m, five-year project called Waste Less, Save More<em>, </em>to tackle food waste.</p> <p>Coupe said price deflation in the market would to continue into summer 2016 as commodity prices fall and competition with discounters Aldi and Lidl continued. “We have closed the gap with the discounters but we think there is room and opportunity for targeted investment in certain categories,” he said.</p> <p>The retailer has taken a £120m hit on profits over the last year by moving its prices 10% closer to the discounters. </p> <p>Asked if profits would continue to fall as Sainsbury’s is forced to cut prices, its finance director, John Rogers, said it was too early to say. <br /> “We are encouraged by the momentum in the business but the reality is that the market remains uncertain and the loss of market share to the discounters from supermarkets overall is still taking place,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/supermarket_takings-zip/giv-311149FBX4V8qpgko/\" data-alt=\"Supermarket takings, 12 weeks to 11 October\"> <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/supermarket_takings-zip/giv-311149FBX4V8qpgko/\">Supermarket takings, 12 weeks to 11 October</a> <figcaption>Supermarket takings, 12 weeks to 11 October</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sainsbury’s said the number of transactions at its tills and the volume of products sold had risen in the half year as shoppers welcomed the lower prices. The group said sales of its top-of-the-range Taste the Difference products had risen 2% while clothing sales were up almost 10% after launching its Tu range online. </p> <p>The retailer said the market remained challenging, blaming food price deflation and tough competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, which has reduced its market share to 16.5%.<br /></p> <p>Sainsbury’s added that its cost savings programme was ahead of plan, with savings of around £225m expected by the end of this financial year, leaving it on track to deliver £500m in cost savings over the next three years. Coupe said: “I am confident we are making progress and we are looking forward to a successful Christmas.”</p> <p>Clive Black, a retail analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital, said: “Sainsbury’s has beaten our expectations, not only financially but in terms of capability and so resilience. The business is increasingly crafting its own identity again, somewhat differentiated ‎as a mass market play by its values, choice of offer and the specification of its wares. </p> <p>“While not immune to the growing presence of the [discounters] to date it has proved to be more capable in withstanding their advances than its value orientated peers.”</p> <p>Sainsbury’s has been opening its own discount stores in the UK in partnership with Danish chain Netto. But a year after the joint venture launched, there are just nine Netto stores open. Coupe would only say performance was “so far so good” and a decision on the next phase of investment will be made early next year.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971985","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405018","internalRevision":"1259","internalContentCode":"458366410","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"First-half profit is retailer’s lowest since 2010 and down from £375m last year, but performance exceeded City analysts’ expectations ","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Sainsbury's braced for another difficult year as profits slide 18%","byline":"Sarah Butler and Julia Kollewe","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T08:44:33Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/957541e52fe6c5df0f74dc44f37107e5aff2eb41/0_0_3228_1937/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5642e806e4b0ddf11c1fbf26","newspaperPageNumber":"37","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-14T08:45:00Z","standfirst":"<p>First-half profit is retailer’s lowest since 2010 and down from £375m last year, but performance exceeded City analysts’ expectations </p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T07:02:30Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T22:01:26.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/sainsburys-profits-slide-amid-supermarket-price-war","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/nov/11/sainsburys-profits-slide-amid-supermarket-price-war","sectionName":"Business","elements":[{"id":"957541e52fe6c5df0f74dc44f37107e5aff2eb41","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/957541e52fe6c5df0f74dc44f37107e5aff2eb41/0_0_3228_1937/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/957541e52fe6c5df0f74dc44f37107e5aff2eb41","suppliersReference":"SLP108","altText":"Mike Coupe","caption":"Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s CEO, said the strategy he set out last year was working.

all started with the snacks. A few months ago I lied to myself that eating “omega booster seeds” or tiny squares of carrot cake was in some way a substitute for nipping out to get a packet of Fruit Gums from the corner shop, and signed up to get “nibbles” delivered directly to my desk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/08/science-research-grants-awarded-on-the-basis-of-patents-is-patently-wrong\">Science research grants awarded on the basis of patents is patently wrong | Kim Carr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, that was just a gateway drug. Now there are days when my desk resembles a bustling village post office in the run-up to Christmas. And once you’ve been identified as sitting at the correct intersection of laziness and disposable income, you get a terrifying insight into quite how many things people want to send to your desk. A shirt in a box for when you’ve spilled your morning latte, or slept in a hedge. Artisan coffee in a box. Craft beer in a box. A “hug in a box”. Gwyneth Paltrow’s head in a box. (No, wait, that’s the end of the movie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/nov/07/clip-joint-moral-dilemmas\" title=\"\">Se7en</a>).</p> <p>Even Uber is at it. Not content with winding up black-cab drivers, the posh minicab app has branched out into, essentially, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/29/technology/uber-kittens/index.html\" title=\"\">kitten pimping</a>: in certain cities in the US and Australia it will deliver cats to your desk between noon and 4pm for 15 minutes of “snuggle time”. (Every fibre of my being says this must be a PR stunt rather than a genuine offer, but feel free to send me pictures of Uber-ordered kittens to prove me wrong. Or indeed any pictures of kittens. I like kittens.)</p> <p>The nadir came when I got a flyer advertising a monthly <a href=\"https://www.pinkparcel.co.uk/\" title=\"\">“pink parcel”</a> I could have delivered to my desk. Yes, that’s right, ladies – leave your co-workers in suspense no longer about why you’re such a mardy cow! For just £7.95 you can let them know that your period is due in three to five days with the arrival of a hamper full of tea bags, beauty products and sweets, plus tampons and sanitary towels. “A cup of tea solves everything!” boasts the Pink Parcel website. (I hear a particularly fragrant Earl Grey has just been appointed Middle East peace envoy, so expect good news from Gaza any time now.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are clearly not many people who wish to pay £7.95 to avoid a trip to Boots for a pack of Always Ultra</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This stuff-in-a-box madness is an offshoot of a larger trend in start-up culture: pandering to middle-class urban professionals who value their time more highly than their disposable income. America, being America, has more eye-watering examples: in Washington DC, <a href=\"https://www.fetchcoffee.com/\" title=\"\">Fetch Coffee</a> will pick up your Starbucks order and, for $3, deliver it to your door before 8am. In big cities <a href=\"http://www.getwashio.com/\" title=\"\">Washio</a> will pick up and return your dry cleaning within 24 hours.</p> <p>Its decision to refer to its workers as “ninjas” makes the website FAQs feel totally surreal. “To be a ninja, you must have a valid in-state driver’s licence, current registration and insurance, a smartphone, and a 2000 model or newer vehicle,” it trills, mentioning nothing about wearing black or killing people with big swords. Often the names of these <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation\" title=\"\">“disruptive” companies</a> are similarly parody-proof, as the dwindling number of available domain names leads to tortured misspellings. Thus, Britain’s answer to “<a href=\"https://www.shyp.com/\" title=\"\">Shyp</a>” (a delivery company) is called “<a href=\"http://weengs.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Weengs</a>”.</p> <p>The biggest problem with the world these companies envisage is that it doesn’t, and never will, exist. Tech start-ups are obsessed with scale, and there are clearly not that many people who have the ability or desire to pay $3 to have a cup of coffee delivered, or £7.95 to avoid a trip to Boots for a pack of Always Ultra.</p> <p>The next issue is that the imagined consumers are partly a reflection of the kind of people who launch a new app or online service: young, well-educated, often from a comfortable family background, and living in one of a handful of cities such as London or San Francisco. In a Vanity Fair article <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/08/is-silicon-valley-in-another-bubble\" title=\"\">asking whether Silicon Valley was in another tech bubble</a>, Nick Bilton quoted an overheard comment that sums up this mindset: “SF tech culture is focused on solving one problem: what is my mother no longer doing for me?”</p> <p>Many of these companies will fail, but here’s the real tragedy: the time and talent wasted on problems that aren’t really problems at all. There is something demented about such a huge flowering of creativity and innovation being focused on the minor inconveniences of the cash-rich and time-poor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/01/science-is-vital-british-legacy-contact-mp\">Science is vital if Britain is to prosper – make sure your MP knows that</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Out there is someone with an idea for an app that would revolutionise elderly care, or an online service that could smooth the life of a low-paid single parent. But those ideas might never even fully form before being dismissed; and they would struggle to attract the buzz and venture capital needed to mature into something truly world-changing. Even the most ardent free-marketeer (and there are plenty of those in Silicon Valley) must acknowledge that there are few commercial incentives to innovate on behalf of those who need it most.</p> <p>That’s where the state comes in. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mazzucato-mariana\" title=\"\">Mariana Mazzucato</a>, one of the economists recently hired to advise Jeremy Corbyn, has a neat line: <a href=\"http://marianamazzucato.com/\" title=\"\">she points out that</a> every major component in the iPhone – Siri, GPS, the touchscreen – exists only because of publicly funded research. So don’t believe Silicon Valley superstars who tell us that they are the only innovators.</p> <p>This is not what the chancellor, George Osborne, wants to hear, of course. As part of his mission to roll back the state, science funding has been frozen since 2010 (meaning a real-terms cut of 6%). Britain now devotes just 1.7% of its GDP to research and development funding – behind the United States (2.8%) and Germany (2.9%), and the European Union target of 3%. There are facilities, built with taxpayers’ money, that we can no longer afford to run – the £400m neutron source in Harwell <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34749609\" title=\"\">can only operate for 120 days a year, for example</a>.</p> <p>Last week the Commons science and technology committee warned that without more investment and the adoption of the 3% target, Britain will fall behind its competitors. “The UK risks losing its status as a world leader in research if the Treasury does not make a long-term commitment to increase science funding,” <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news-parliament-2015/the-science-budget-report-published-15-16/\" title=\"\">said the committee chair, Nicola Blackwood</a>.</p> <p>This might all sound too dry to care about – God knows, any mention of EU targets always makes my eyes glaze over – but it’s important to our future. We can either encourage innovation and research to benefit everyone, by properly funding our science sector. Or we can leave it to the market, and get more laundry ninjas, more companies called things like Coffeeee and undrPants, and most of all, more bloody boxes sent to my desk.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10969982","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405352","internalRevision":"88","internalContentCode":"458368959","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"A huge flowering of creativity is focused on the minor inconveniences of the cash-rich and time-poor.

British journalists held for more than five months in an Indonesian prison have described their relief at being back on UK soil but criticised the Foreign Office for a dismissive attitude they said had left them feeling alone.</p> <p>Documentary film-makers Rebecca Prosser, 31, and Neil Bonner, 32, said they had been treated like petty criminals by the British government.<br /></p> <p>“The FCO need to figure out how they protect journalists,” said Bonner, speaking to the Guardian after the pair touched down at Heathrow. “We were treated like common criminals, as far as they were concerned. It was a complex, political case and they chose to use the same line as if we had been caught taking five kilos of cocaine into the country.”<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e37b70cc6af9cdd222957360ff59bb7d6e16301\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3e37b70cc6af9cdd222957360ff59bb7d6e16301/0_0_4025_2415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prosser being embraced by family and friends.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prosser being embraced by family and friends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bonner and Prosser were detained by the Indonesian navy on the island of Batam in May while filming a documentary about piracy and corruption in the military in the strait of Malacca on behalf of production company Wall to Wall. </p> <p>They were threatened with charges including being a threat to national security, which carries up to 12 years in prison, but after months in detention were convicted of not having correct visas and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/03/uk-journalists-guilty-indonesia-neil-bonner-rebecca-prosser-immigration-laws\">sentenced to two-and-a-half months</a>, meaning they could leave prison immediately because of time served. </p> <p>“I’ve worked in many different countries where I thought the UK government would help me if things went wrong,” Bonner said. “Now I realise I am on my own. We were well supported by friends, families and our company Wall to Wall, but if we didn’t have that, if we’d been working for a small company that couldn’t afford support, we would have been in serious trouble.”<br /></p> <p>An FCO statement expressing concern was “literally a cut-and-paste job”, Bonner said. “We were disappointed with big mistakes that were made that could have jeopardised our safety.”<br /></p> <p>Prosser said the FCO initially failed to send a diplomatic notice to Indonesia about their case. “There is a specific document which governments can send expressing interest in a case, noting the British government is watching it at the highest levels and due process must be followed,” she said. “We were told it had been sent, and a month later our families followed up and it was never sent. That could have really compromised us. We don’t know how that affected the case.”<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d75070e0475c95f12f689a625d159db6082a6062\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d75070e0475c95f12f689a625d159db6082a6062/0_426_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prosser and Bonner after arriving at Heathrow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prosser and Bonner after arriving at Heathrow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout their detention, the pair said they suspected their case was being closely monitored by the Indonesian military and was about far more than irregular visas. A senior Indonesian navy commander, Rear Admiral Taufiqurrahman, told the Jakarta Post that the film-makers “could tarnish the image of the Malacca strait as a crime-prone area”.<br /></p> <p>“The navy monitored our whole case,” Bonner said. “They would turn up to see us in prison, illegally, they would visit the prosecutor, according to our lawyer. They were adamant they wanted the case to go to court.”<br /></p> <p>Bonner said: “We were very concerned we were being used as political pawns between hardliners and liberals over press freedom, which is a big issue right now.”<br /></p> <p>Prosser said: “The national security charge eventually evaporated, they bandied about another charge from the 1950s about foreigners inciting unrest. They were looking for anything they could get us with.”<br /></p> <p>Both said they had not been expecting the conditions in prison to be as bad as they were, though being foreigners afforded them some privileges. “It was massively overcrowded,” Bonner said. “The conditions were shocking and much, much worse for other prisoners, who were in cells for nine people with 22 crammed in, for 23 hours a day. <br /></p> <p>“Money buys you everything, and we got some privileges because eyes were on us. Fresh air is expensive, money buys you fresh air in prison, you don’t get to leave your cell unless you pay.”<br /></p> <p>Prosser said: “We washed from troughs with plastic buckets, we ate dirty food, I got infections and the clinic there didn’t have the medicine to treat it properly. We have visitors who could bring us things so we were lucky. Leaving prison, I actually felt a sense of hopelessness for the people I met, who have no hope of justice at all. I feel a responsibility to them.”<br /></p> <p>At Heathrow the pair were greeted by dozens of whooping friends and colleagues from as far afield as Glasgow, many of whom pushed through the barriers to embrace them. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62a2a246436877e7b0c6246b347b6359af1e27ed\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/62a2a246436877e7b0c6246b347b6359af1e27ed/0_542_4176_2505/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prosser and Bonner surrounded by their welcoming committee at Heathrow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prosser and Bonner surrounded by their welcoming committee at Heathrow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The welcoming committee wore striped shirts – a favourite design of Prosser’s – and blond moustaches like the one Bonner had sported before his detention. Prosser’s six-year-old nephew had been given special permission by teachers to be there, his aunt’s homecoming considered “exceptional circumstances”. <br /></p> <p>“I feel like my strength is coming back, now they’re home,” said Bonner’s mother, Barbara Shaw. “I had days where I would just burst into tears at anything, just cry at adverts, filling in forms at work. It’s been so hard and we’ve had to keep it all bottled up.”<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/british-journalist-indonesia-rebecca-prosser-neil-bonner\">Sister pays tribute to  British journalist held in Indonesia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prosser’s father, Bernard, who had travelled from Birmingham with her mother, Carmel, said he felt a weight had been lifted but also criticised the governments of the UK and Indonesia for their attitude towards journalists. “It’s plain intimidation, we know that.

is endangering efforts by local communities around the UK to build their own renewable energy projects.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/289337344/Boris-Johnson-to-David-Gauke-on-community-energy-tax-changes\">a letter</a> to the financial secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, the mayor of London and Tory MP called on the government to reconsider <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm151026/debtext/151026-0002.htm#15102612000001\">its proposals to remove various forms of tax relief for investors in community energy</a>.</p> <p>More than 100 green energy groups have already said the change <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/05/treasury-tax-plans-will-decimate-community-energy-projects\">will “decimate” the sector</a>, which has installed community-owned solar panels on village halls, small hydro schemes on rivers and wind turbines on farms.</p> <p>Johnson is concerned that “the proposals may endanger the expansion of the sector given the investment required for the upfront capital costs” and “there is a danger of unintended consequences”, wrote the deputy mayor for environment and energy, Matthew Pencharz.</p> <p>The mayor also thought that while such schemes might be small individually, in aggregate they are important to the security of London’s future energy supply, and a key part of efforts to cut the capital’s carbon emissions.</p> <p>The short-term nature of the tax changes - which are due to come into effect at the end of November - could also put an end to schemes that are already in development or fundraising, he said. </p> <p>One high-profile scheme for a community-owned solar array in a West Sussex village that was at the centre of anti-fracking protests, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/06/solar-farm-in-balcombe-fracking-village-shelved-due-to-tory-policies\">has already been shelved</a> as a result of the Treasury’s plans, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm151026/debtext/151026-0002.htm#15102612000001\">announced in the finance bill last month</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/20/tory-cuts-solar-subsidies-threaten-community-projects-worth-over-100m\">A recent report</a> found more than £100m worth of community energy projects were at risk from the changes.</p> <p>Johnson and Pencharz suggested the Treasury could assign a “light touch” role to local authorities, which are already involved in community energy schemes, to avoid abuse of the tax relief scheme.<br /></p> <p>A Treasury spokesperson said: “The government is committed to supporting the investment and innovation needed to achieve a cost-effective transition to a low-carbon economy, but we also want to do this in a way that is fair and provides value for money to hardworking taxpayers.”</p> <p>It has also emerged that Johnson is considering having Transport for London (TfL) buy zero-emission black cabs and lease them back to taxi drivers as part of his efforts to tackle London’s air pollution. The capital <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/10/uk-cities-breach-eu-pollution-limits-2030\">has been in breach of EU safety limits for nitrogen dioxide</a>, a toxic gas produced by diesel vehicles such as black cabs, since 2010.<br /></p> <p>In a letter to London assembly member Stephen Knight dated 3 November, the mayor wrote: “TfL is currently considering the proposal to purchase and supply zero-emission capable taxis to taxi drivers in London.” Zero-emissions capable taxis would suggest electric or hydrogen cars.</p> <p>However, he cautioned: “This is a complex proposal and needs to be considered carefully given that TfL is the regulator for the taxi and private hire trades in London.” TfL already operates a similar leasing model for the new Routemaster buses.</p> <p>Knight welcomed the possibility of electric black cabs: “Switching London’s black taxi fleet over from diesel to electric vehicles is an essential part of tackling dangerous air pollution in the capital. Electric taxis have the benefit of low running costs, but the barrier to their fast and widespread adoption is the very high initial purchase price of these new and innovative vehicles.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10972310","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2404705","internalRevision":"1014","internalContentCode":"458363755","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Mayor of London calls on the government to reconsider plans to remove tax relief for investors in community energy projects","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Boris Johnson: Treasury is endangering community renewables","byline":"Adam Vaughan","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T14:13:28Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/ac035674d240156bee47806f3541c4a656789fde/0_303_5760_3456/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5642146ae4b00d947b614d29","newspaperPageNumber":"20","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-14T14:15:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Mayor of London calls on the government to reconsider plans to remove tax relief for investors in community energy projects</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-10T15:59:38Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T22:01:42.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/11/boris-johnson-treasury-is-endangering-community-renewables","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/11/boris-johnson-treasury-is-endangering-community-renewables","sectionName":"Environment","elements":[{"id":"22aedd0a0376dc72f85bd06facf40ca88aaf68ea","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/22aedd0a0376dc72f85bd06facf40ca88aaf68ea/0_340_5120_3072/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Kristian Buus","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/22aedd0a0376dc72f85bd06facf40ca88aaf68ea","altText":"The launch of a solar panel system at Banister House, Hackney, an example of a community energy project.

It was initially banned by the Lord Chamberlain in 1907 and the first night of this revival by a National Theatre that Barker did so much to inspire was marked by misfortune: a few minutes before the end, a spectator collapsed in the stalls and there was a prolonged hiatus while an ambulance was called. Eventually the play continued, but much of the momentum was lost.</p> <p>It remains a remarkable play in its combination of sex, politics and religion. The action hinges on the determination of an independent MP, Henry Trebell, to bring in a bill to disestablish the Church of England and devote its wealth to education. But, shortly before he is due to join an incoming Tory government that will push the bill through, Trebell impregnates the wife of a former Irish republican. The result is fatal, both to the woman in question, Amy O’Connell, and to Trebell’s visionary dream.</p> <p>Barker’s overriding theme is barrenness: above all, the barrenness of a life such as Trebell’s, in which ideals matter more than individuals. It’s a theme skilfully reflected in Roger Michell’s production by Hildegard Bechtler’s sets in which sleekly sliding panels reveal sterile interiors. But the big theme is also embodied in Charles Edwards’s superb performance as Trebell. When arguing the case for his bill and talking of the “hunger for knowledge”, Edwards’s eyes blaze with missionary zeal. Left alone with Amy, he resorts either to brusque cold-heartedness (“my time for lovemaking is limited”) or to a stumbling hesitancy. In Edwards’s hands, the play becomes the tragedy of a man who reserves his passion for principles rather than people.</p> <p>Barker’s language may not have the Mozartian musicality of Shaw and his play takes time to get going. But, in addition to acute psychological understanding, he shows a laser-like eye for the hypocrisies and shifting alliances of political life. The great moment comes in the third act, when we see the future members of a Tory cabinet first trying to hush up a sexual scandal and then gradually disowning Trebell. Even if this production doesn’t efface memories of the last <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/04/theatre8\">Almeida revival</a>, there are sharply observant performances from Michael Elwyn as the manipulative Tory leader, Gerrard McArthur as a silky moralist and Louis Hilyer as a booming pragmatist. Barker’s point that women are victims of male power structures is also impeccably reinforced by Sylvestra Le Touzel as Trebell’s devoted sister and Olivia Williams as his abandoned mistress. </p> <p>I noticed a few empty seats on the first night, but this is a play that deserves packed houses for its unsparing dissection of the ongoing English malaise. </p> <ul> <li>At the Lyttelton theatre, London, until 19 March. <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/waste\">Box office: 020-7452 3000</a><br /></li> </ul>","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405078","internalRevision":"298","internalContentCode":"458366980","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Morals, shifting alliances and hypocrisy are the big themes in this tragic psychological portrait of a man for whom ideals matter more than individuals ","allowUgc":"false","starRating":"4","headline":"Waste review – a remarkable dissection of English malaise","byline":"Michael Billington","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T13:42:32Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/da45e791580970868b701aafe854ac6dd3485ee9/134_270_2778_1667/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"564312a9e4b00d947b614eb0","newspaperPageNumber":"19","commentCloseDate":"2015-12-11T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p><strong>Lyttelton theatre, London<br></strong>Morals, sexual politics and hypocrisy are the big themes in this tragic psychological portrait of a man for whom ideals matter more than individuals </p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T10:04:25Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T23:07:24.116Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/nov/11/waste-review-lyttelton-national-theatre-london-harley-granville-barker","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2015/nov/11/waste-review-lyttelton-national-theatre-london-harley-granville-barker","sectionName":"Stage","elements":[{"id":"da45e791580970868b701aafe854ac6dd3485ee9","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/da45e791580970868b701aafe854ac6dd3485ee9/134_270_2778_1667/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2015 Rex Features.

Yellow warnings have been added for the rest of Scotland for between 6pm on Thursday and 2pm on Friday.</p> <p>The Met Office said the north and north-west of Scotland were likely to see severe south-westerly gales on Thursday, and strong winds would extend across the Northern Isles into Friday morning. The forecasters said gusts of 60-70mph were expected, with some gusts of more than 90mph in exposed locations.</p> <p>The chief meteorologist Paul Gunderson said: “In terms of impact, the Western Isles, north of Scotland and Orkney could see winds of 90mph with potential impacts upon transport and maybe power supplies too. We could see quite a lot of lightning as well and high tides, so with that in mind we have upgraded to amber.”</p> <p>The ferry operator CalMac warned of likely disruption to services and urged travellers to think carefully if planning to visit the west coast. Its operations director Drew Collier said: “There is a clear warning that major weather-related disruption to ferry services on the Clyde and Hebrides routes is likely later this week, so I would urge people to factor this in when making travel plans. The sea conditions we are expecting could well be too treacherous to sail in.”</p> <p>Motorists are also being warned to expect disruption. An RAC spokesman said: “Strong, sudden gusts of wind can be very dangerous for motorists driving in exposed areas so we are urging motorists not to be caught out by Storm Abigail. The invisible force of the wind can lead to vehicles unexpectedly being knocked off course, sometimes with devastating consequences. Drivers should particularly be ready to compensate for the effects of wind hitting their vehicles when passing lorries.”</p> <p>It is hoped the “name our storms” project by the Met Office and Met Eireann will help raise awareness of severe weather and ensure greater safety of the public. Storms are being named when they are deemed to have the potential to cause a substantial impact in the UK and/or Ireland.</p> <p>Abigail was first on the list of winning names, followed by Barney, Clodagh, Desmond, Eva, Frank, Gertrude, Henry, Imogen, Jake, Katie, Lawrence, Mary, Nigel, Orla, Phil, Rhonda, Steve, Tegan, Vernon and Wendy.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10972154","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405605","internalRevision":"215","internalContentCode":"458371386","publication":"The

row with the main anti-EU group after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eric-pickles\">Sir Eric Pickles</a> called for it to be denied the right to lead the campaign for the leave side in the referendum.</p> <p>Vote Leave accused No 10 of panicking after the former cabinet minister said he believed the group had disqualified itself by pledging to run a “nasty” campaign against opponents.</p> <p>The intervention came as a new poll showed that David Cameron will improve his chances of securing a vote to stay in Europe in the referendum if he wins the support of Boris Johnson. Peter Kellner, the founder of the YouGov polling company, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/\">reports in Prospect</a> that the pro-EU campaign would see its majority lifted from three points to 18 if the two men campaigned for an in vote. If Cameron campaigned to stay in and Johnson campaigned to leave, the bounce would be half as much – at eight points.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/11/eric-pickles-says-vote-leave-campaign-should-be-denied-lead-status\">Eric Pickles says Vote Leave campaign should be denied lead status</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prime minister would secure a majority of Tory voters (51% to 31%) for a vote to stay in Europe if he teams up with Johnson, who has flirted with the Vote Leave campaign but who welcomed Cameron’s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/10/david-cameron-migration-letter-eu-demands\">speech on EU negotiations</a> on Tuesday. Tory voters would side with the in campaign by a more narrow margin (41% to 38%) if the prime minister and the London mayor campaign on opposing sides.</p> <p>Downing Street is likely to welcome the intervention by Pickles, who cited Vote Leave’s role in helping <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/09/cameron-vows-to-throw-himself-headlong-into-keeping-britain-in-a-reformed-eu\">students to gain entry to the CBI annual conference</a> under false pretences, where they heckled Cameron, as he called for the group to be denied official designation. In a letter to the Electoral Commission’s chief executive, Claire Bassett, he wrote: “I believe the actions of Vote Leave in disrupting the CBI conference and declaring a strategy of intimidation and protest disqualify Vote Leave from being a designated lead campaigner in the forthcoming <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">EU referendum</a> campaign.”</p> <p>Vote Leave claimed that the Pickles letter had been prompted by panic in No 10 after what it described as the failure of Cameron’s EU renegotiation strategy. A spokesman for the group said: “No 10 is panicking. The PM’s letter to the EU has bombed, so now they are rolling out former ministers to deflect for their own failure.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/10/david-cameron-migration-letter-eu-demands\">David Cameron signals flexibility on migrant benefits in EU letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a sign of the poisonous relations between Vote Leave and No 10, the group’s campaign director, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odysseanproject?lang=en-gb\">Dominic Cummings</a>, described the prime minister’s letter to the European council president, Donald Tusk, as “low-grade spin”. Cummings, a former special adviser to Michael Gove, said Cameron had tabled modest demands to ensure he can campaign to keep Britain in the EU.</p> <p>Downing Street issued a lengthy point-by-point document on Tuesday night challenging the claims by Vote Leave. The group hit back on Wednesday by releasing a document to show that No 10 was guilty of a “major strategic blunder” after making false claims about Cameron’s own track record on the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b22f2f9019b47438e2c7c8faa6b4ab060d7b902\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1b22f2f9019b47438e2c7c8faa6b4ab060d7b902/0_429_4683_2812/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vote Leave’s campaign director, Dominic Cummings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vote Leave’s campaign director, Dominic Cummings, has warned that companies campaigning to stay in the EU are in his “crosshairs”.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The row between the group, which is run by Matthew Elliott, who helped Cameron defeat Nick Clegg’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/06/av-referendum-deals-liberal-democrats-blow\">proposal for electoral reform in a referendum in 2011</a>, will fuel speculation that the prime minister will lead the pro-EU campaign in the referendum. The <a href=\"http://conservativesforbritain.org/\">Conservatives for Britain</a> group is planning a formal tie-up with Vote Leave amid fears that the signs from ministers that they are willing to soften Cameron’s most controversial demand – a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits – suggests that No 10 is determined to keep Britain in the EU.</p> <p>Pickles, who was appointed as the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sir-eric-pickles-to-examine-electoral-fraud\">government’s anti-corruption</a> champion after he left the cabinet in May, decided to intervene after Vote Leave <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/anti-eu-protesters-created-fake-firm-to-heckle-david-cameron-during-cbi-speech-a6727041.html\">set up a fake company</a> to allow two student protestors to gain entry to the CBI conference. </p> <p>Cummings launched a strong defence of his tactics as he warned that companies that campaign to stay in the EU were in his “crosshairs”. He <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11984824/EU-referendum-campaign-is-about-to-get-nasty-say-Eurosceptic-campaigners.html\">told the Daily Telegraph</a>: “You think it is nasty? You ain’t seen nothing yet.”</p> <p>The Pickles letter highlighted bitter relations between the two leave camps. Arron Banks, the head of the <a href=\"https://leave.eu/\">Leave.EU campaign</a>, said: “This goes against the grain totally and it pains me to say this but on this occasion Sir Eric Pickles is right. If we are to gain the trust of the British people in this campaign then provocative stunts and schoolboy politics is not the answer.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971945","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405562","internalRevision":"1336","internalContentCode":"458371068","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Group accuses Downing Street of panicking following criticism from Sir Eric Pickles, while new poll shows Boris Johnson is crucial to in vote’s chances","allowUgc":"false","headline":"No 10 in row with Vote Leave over group's anti-EU campaign role","byline":"Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-12T00:01:02Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8bf4b560fe8f2e721a959794bddaec63dfac06cf/38_269_3027_1817/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5643823ae4b04096fed8b51a","newspaperPageNumber":"21","standfirst":"<p>Group accuses Downing Street of panicking following criticism from Sir Eric Pickles, while new poll shows Boris Johnson is crucial to in vote’s chances</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T18:00:26Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T00:01:04.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/12/no-10-row-vote-leave-right-lead-anti-eu-campaign","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/nov/12/no-10-row-vote-leave-right-lead-anti-eu-campaign","sectionName":"Politics","elements":[{"id":"8bf4b560fe8f2e721a959794bddaec63dfac06cf","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8bf4b560fe8f2e721a959794bddaec63dfac06cf/38_269_3027_1817/140.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2015 Rex Features.

Intended to recognise “writing at its most novel”, and to “reward fiction that breaks the mould or extends the possibilities of the novel form”, the inaugural Goldsmiths award went to Eimear McBride’s stream-of-consciousness A Girl Is a Half-formed Thing, while Ali Smith won the prize last year for her dual narrative How to Be Both.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/08/kevin-barry-interview-beatlebone-john-lennon-city-of-bohane\">Kevin Barry: ‘I want to go as wild as I can within my stories’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Beatlebone is set in 1978, and follows the 37-year-old Lennon as he travels to the west coast of Ireland, planning to visit the island he owns and undergo primal scream therapy.</p> <p>“Love, blood, fate, death, sex, the void, mother, father, cunt and prick – these are the things on his mind,” writes Barry. “He will spend three days alone on his island. That is all that he asks. That he might scream his fucking lungs out and scream the days into nights and scream to the stars by night – if stars there are and the stars come through.”</p> <p>Josh Cohen, chair of the judging panel, said that “intricately weaving and blurring fiction and life, Beatlebone embodies beautifully this prize’s spirit of creative risk”, and that he was “proud to crown it our winner”. </p> <p>Cohen, who is professor of modern literary theory at Goldsmiths, was joined on the panel of judges by McBride, her fellow author Jon McGregor. The New Statesman, which co-founded the award with Goldsmiths, was represented on the judging panel by its lead fiction reviewer Leo Robson.</p> <p>Writing in the Guardian last month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/oct/01/eimear-mcbride-goldsmiths-prize-2015-shortlist\">McBride said</a> that Beatlebone was a “storm of a novel – unsettling and mesmerising. It’s formally interesting also, with the novelist choosing to step on and off the page.”</p> <p>She also acknowledged the panel’s “discussion of the low number of eligible entries by women”. This led to an all-male shortlist, with Barry’s novel competing with titles by Richard Beard, Magnus Mills, Tom McCarthy, Max Porter and Adam Thirlwell.</p> <p>“Given the prize’s previously unblemished record, hopefully this year will prove a blip,” said McBride.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10972254","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405465","internalRevision":"325","internalContentCode":"458370172","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Award for innovative fiction goes to Beatlebone by Kevin Barry, praised by judges for its ‘spirit of creative risk’","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Novel about John Lennon and primal screaming wins Goldsmiths prize","byline":"Alison Flood","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T19:30:02Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f3c211839649e1802232a465dec46a48f5049fc1/861_931_2673_1601/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56436983e4b0a6d5cb677a64","newspaperPageNumber":"20","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-18T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Award for innovative fiction goes to Beatlebone by Kevin Barry, praised by judges for its ‘spirit of creative risk’</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T16:14:59Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T00:15:03.414Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/11/novel-about-john-lennon-and-primal-screaming-wins-goldsmiths-prize","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/nov/11/novel-about-john-lennon-and-primal-screaming-wins-goldsmiths-prize","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f3c211839649e1802232a465dec46a48f5049fc1","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f3c211839649e1802232a465dec46a48f5049fc1/861_931_2673_1601/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright, no syndication, no redistribution, Murdo Macleods repro fees apply.

Mr Nash came to the barrier to save his son but was shot in the arm and body. </p> <p>It is understood the soldier gave evidence to the government-commissioned inquiry into Bloody Sunday, undertaken by Lord Saville, under the cipher Lance Corporal J. </p> <p>Thirteen people were killed by members of the Parachute Regiment on the day of the incident. Another victim of the shootings died in hospital four months later. </p> <p>The PSNI’s murder investigation into the events of Bloody Sunday was launched in 2012. It was initiated after the Saville Inquiry found that none of the victims was posing a threat to soldiers when they were shot. </p> <p>Following the publication of the Saville report in 2010, prime minister David Cameron apologised for the Army’s actions, branding them “unjustified and unjustifiable”. </p> <p>In September, the PSNI announced their intention to interview seven former soldiers about their involvement on the day. <br

Lambert, have been announced as headliners of next year’s Isle of Wight festival, in the band’s only confirmed live UK date of 2016.</p> <p>The closing Sunday night show will be the band’s first performance at a UK music festival – a festival that guitarist Brian May says the former frontman Freddie Mercury would have loved to attend. “I think Queen at the Isle of Wight festival is a date that was long overdue,” May said. “How incredible to take on this challenge at this point in our lives. With an injection of new blood in the shape of the incredible Adam Lambert, Queen will be ready to tear it up on this legendary stage in 2016. Freddie would have loved it. Can’t wait.”</p> <p>Drummer Roger Taylor added: “When I think of the Isle of Wight festival, I think of Hendrix, Dylan and the Who. What immortal company to be in. Queen are thrilled to be there and can promise a special night.”</p> <p>Former American Idol contestant Lambert, whose single Ghost Town has been streamed more than 100 million times, said: “I’m so excited to be a part of the Isle of Wight Festival and share the stage once again with the Queen family. I adore making music with Roger and Brian, and am thrilled to help continue their legacy into 2016. It is true I have large shoes to fill, so I’m urgently planning on searching for a new pair of boots – or five – to wear for the set.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/nov/04/bohemian-rhapsody-queen-exclusive-shots-hammersmith-1975-in-pictures\">40 years of Bohemian Rhapsody: exclusive shots of Queen – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The act are the first headliners to be announced for the festival, which will be marking the 15th year since it was relaunched by promoter John Giddings. Giddings said: “It’s the perfect way for us to celebrate our 15th anniversary. Queen’s music appeals to people of all generations and it’s hard to think of another band with such a famous collection of songs. It’s going to be an incredible moment for the Isle of Wight Festival when they share these songs with us.”</p> <p>This year also marks the 40th anniversary of the release of Queen’s single Bohemian Rhapsody, which was memorably played on the band’s 26-date Queen Invite You to a Night at the Opera tour in 1975. </p> <p>Lambert first joined the band for live shows <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/21/queen-adam-lambert-freddie-mercury\">in 2012</a>.

hurl themselves into detailed and heated disputes over the fundamentals of modern conservatism. Donald Trump clashed with Jeb Bush over immigration, Rand Paul took on Marco Rubio, while Ben Carson was deeply tested over his knowledge of foreign affairs and the veracity of his own personal story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/11/trumps-still-sexist-carson-called-isis-losers-but-poor-debates-arent-hurting-the-frontrunners-yet\">Trump's still sexist. Carson called Isis 'losers'. But poor debates aren't hurting the frontrunners yet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The media hosts of the fourth Republican presidential debate, Fox Business and the Wall Street Journal, promised that it would be the most substantive on the issues that Americans cared about. And it delivered.</p> <p>The populist grandstanding of the so-called “outsider” candidates – notably Trump and Carson – came under more detailed scrutiny than in any previous debate. Trump in particular was challenged over his headline-grabbing promise to round up and eject the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants. </p> <p>Jeb Bush, whose campaign has been seriously flagging in recent weeks as he struggled to find his voice, came out guns blazing in a derisive take-down of the Trump position. “Twelve million illegal immigrants, to send them back, 500,000 a month, is just not possible. And it’s not embracing American values. And it would tear communities apart. And it would send a signal that we’re not the kind of country that I know America is.”</p> <p>Feeling the wind finally in his sails, Bush pressed on. He said that even having a conversation about forced deportation of millions of law-abiding people “sends a powerful signal. They’re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this, that’s the problem with this”.</p> <p>Ohio governor John Kasich also attacked Trump on his crude immigration plan, insisting: “Come on folks, we all know you can’t pick them up and ship them across a border. It’s a silly argument. It’s not an adult argument.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab619d50fd851b8d63c6dab1925d750f9adb46aa\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ab619d50fd851b8d63c6dab1925d750f9adb46aa/0_377_5591_3355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bush and Kasich\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republican presidential candidates Jeb Bush, right, and John Kasich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His phrase caught the mood of the night, when more experienced politicians snatched back control of the conversation. Bush was not the only experienced politician on the stage who palpably felt the momentum of the presidential contest move in their direction, away from the hitherto ascendant “outsiders”. Rand Paul too came into his own to an extent not previously seen in any of the three earlier debates.</p> <p>In one of the most substantive discussions of the night, the Kentucky Republican took on Marco Rubio over their respective interpretations of conservatism as it applied to government spending on domestic welfare and the military. When Rubio talked about introducing a new family-friendly tax system, Paul pounced, denouncing the plan as a new trillion-dollar expense on the federal budget.</p> <p>“He’s talking about giving people money they didn’t pay. It’s a welfare transfer payment,” Paul said, adding it didn’t look very conservative to him. He then went on to lambast Rubio’s plan to increase spending on the US military by a similar trillion dollars. “How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures? You cannot be a conservative if you’re going to keep promoting new programs you’re not going to pay for.”</p> <p>Rubio lashed back by branding Paul a “committed isolationist”. “I believe the world is a stronger and a better place, and the United States is the strongest military power in the world. There are radical jihadists beheading people and crucifying Christians.”</p> <p>It was a difficult night for Ben Carson, who was exposed to one of the only non-economic questions of the evening when he was asked whether recent press coverage of inaccuracies in his personal story had damaged his standing. Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, has faced a recent flurry of news stories suggesting that he juiced up his personal biography. He has been shown to have exaggerated or misrepresented his own accounts that he <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ben-carson-west-point-215598\">turned down a scholarship</a> to West Point military academy, tried to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/05/politics/ben-carson-2016-childhood-violence/\">stab a friend at school</a> and was rewarded by his professors for being the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-journal-says-ben-carson-lied-about-being-most-honest-student-while-at-yale-2015-11\">most honest student in his class at Yale</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/10/donald-trump-ben-carson-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4e4h8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2404709\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: 'Stabbing someone helps in polls this election' – video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-564214ebe4b00d947b614d2d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/10/151110trump_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/11/10/151110trump_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/10/151110trump_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/10/151110trump_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/10/151110trump.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/10/donald-trump-ben-carson-video\">Donald Trump: ‘Stabbing someone helps in polls this election’</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He tried to deflect the question by turning it back on the media in an echo of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/28/republican-debate-cnbc-media-economic-policy\">attack leveled by Republican candidates at CNBC</a> over the debate two weeks ago. Carson said the assault on his trustworthiness by the media was unfair compared with the treatment of Hillary Clinton’s narrative over Benghazi.</p> <p>“We should vet all candidates, I have no problem being vetted but I do have a problem with being lied about and putting that out there as truth. We have to start treating people the same.”</p> <p>Carson also faced difficulties over his approach to raising the minimum wage and tax policy. <br /></p> <p>Within the first 10 minutes of the debate, he flip-flopped on his policy when he told moderator Neil Cavuto: “I would not raise [the minimum wage]. I would not raise it specifically because I’m interested in making sure that people are able to enter the job market and take advantage of opportunities.”</p> <p>However, in May, Carson favored raising the federal minimum wage. He said then <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/241449-ben-carson-backs-raising-minimum-wage\">in an interview on CNBC</a>: “I think, probably, it should be higher than now.”</p> <p>Carson later said he would favor getting rid of tax deductions for home mortgages and charitable giving, which are two of the most popular and widely used tax deductions. He stood by this statement after the debate, saying he was “100%” in favor of removing both from the tax code. <br /></p> <p>In a further assault on his image of calm but assured statesmanship, Carson also exposed his limited knowledge of the complexities of foreign affairs when he talked about his proposed way of dealing with Isis. The important thing, he said, was to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/10/ben-carson-republican-debate-isis-losers\">treat the Islamist extremists as “losers”</a>, and to take the land they controlled in Iraq away from them.</p> <p>The more detailed the level of discussion, the more edged out of the limelight both Carson and Trump appeared. When historians look back on the 2016 presidential race, they may come to see Milwaukee as a tipping point in which the more establishment politicians within the crowded field of contestants finally came into their own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/10/ben-carson-republican-debate-isis-losers\">Ben Carson: I will make Isis 'look like losers' if elected president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump also sounded maverick on foreign policy, saying that he was quite happy with Russian president Vladimir Putin going in to Syria to fight the Isis insurgents. That gave Bush the second chance of the night to assert his desperately struggling bid for the Republican nomination. </p> <p>“Donald is absolutely wrong on this. The idea of letting Putin take out Isis, that’s like a board game, like playing Monopoly or something, that’s not how the world works,” he said.</p> <p>While Bush and Paul both left a greater imprint on the race than they have up to now, other candidates on stage found it more difficult to leave their mark. Ted Cruz made a forceful statement on immigration, pinning his colors to the same mast as Trump by opposing any concession to any of the 11 million undocumented individuals. Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, stuck largely to a familiar script about her business prowess though she did receive a resounding cheer from the audience when she exclaimed: “We must take our government back.”</p> <p>In the post-debate spin room Trump praised the debate as “an elegant evening” compared to the controversial CNBC debate just two weeks before. Other presidentical campaigns took turns declaring victory. Doug Stafford, the top strategist for Paul, said of his candidate: “I thought Rand really stood out from everyone in this debate and showed himself to be the real, true fiscal conservative on every issue.” Michael Steel, a top aide to Bush, also felt comfortable about his candidate’s performance. “I think Governor Bush showed again why he’s the best choice to be the next commander in chief and did the best job making a contrast with Hillary Clinton on question after question.” <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Earlier in the evening, in the undercard debate, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, newly relegated from the top tier by dint of low poll ratings, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/10/chris-christie-dominates-republican-debate-undercard\">also helped to resurrect his moribund campaign</a> by strategically turning his remaining firepower on Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>Christie said Clinton was “the one to fight tonight”, the one who would inflate public spending were she to get into the White House. “The people out there … care about who’s going to beat Hillary Clinton and who’s going to keep their eye on the ball. I’m going to keep my eye on the ball,” he said.</p> <p>Christie’s statesmanlike tone earned him a plaudit from Rupert Murdoch, the CEO of News Corp which owns the host media organizations, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/664256688824782849?lang=en\">who tweeted about him</a>: “Possible to see as Chief

offering a Conservative council chief special access to No 10 advisers as a way to resolve a disagreement about proposed budget cuts.</p> <p>The prime minister is facing questions about his conduct after he wrote to Ian Hudspeth, the leader of Oxfordshire county council, chastising him for considering cuts to day centres, libraries and museums. Cameron’s own constituency of Witney falls within the area.</p> <p>In the letter, Cameron extended an offer for how to help to manage the cuts, saying he would be happy to “initiate a dialogue” with the No 10 policy unit about the possibilities of devolution deals and suggesting that Hudspeth contact his aide Sheridan Westlake, who used to work in the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p> <p>The intervention sparked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/11/david-cameron-letter-cuts-oxfordshire\">accusations of hypocrisy</a> after the leaked letter showed Cameron criticising Hudspeth for considering cuts to local services. Hudspeth responded by taking issue with Cameron’s argument point by point, noting that central government funding had fallen dramatically. The exchange was <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/13948252.David_Cameron_clashes_with_council_over_cuts_to_frontline_services/\">obtained by the Oxford Mail</a>.</p> <p>Hudspeth told Cameron that the council had already cut back-office functions and looked at shared services as far back as 2006, reduced staff numbers by thousands and disposed of property. He pointed out new functions that had transferred to the council, including public health and social care.</p> <p>“Excluding schools, our total government grants have fallen from £194m in 2009/10 to £122m a year in 2015/16, and are projected to keep falling at a similar rate. I cannot accept your description of a drop in funding of £72m or 37% as a ‘slight fall’,” he wrote. Hudspeth also said he had “worked hard to assist you in achieving a Conservative majority”.</p> <p>Jon Ashworth, a shadow Cabinet Office minister, has written to the civil service chief Sir Jeremy Heywood asking for advice on the propriety of Cameron offering extra help for Oxfordshire.<br /></p> <p>He points out that the letter appears to have been written by the prime minister in his role as a Witney MP, even though the ministerial code states that he must keep separate his government and constituency role.</p> <p>“Is it the case that if the prime minister has made this offer of ‘further dialogue’ available to the leader of his local county council, similar offers should be made to all the leaders of other councils? Surely the leader of the prime minister’s county council should not be given preferential treatment?” Ashworth writes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/11/david-cameron-letter-cuts-oxfordshire\">David Cameron hasn’t the faintest idea how deep his cuts go. This letter proves it | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He asks for confirmation of whether the proposed meeting between Hudspeth and the policy unit has taken place and whether similar offers have been made to other council leaders.</p> <p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the letter showed unbelievable hypocrisy. He said:<strong> “</strong>I’m backing David Cameron on this one. He is absolutely right that his chancellor’s cuts to local government are seriously damaging our communities and have to be opposed. I welcome the prime minister as another Tory MP joining our campaign against George Osborne’s cuts.”</p> <p>A spokesman for Cameron said: “There is still significant scope for sensible savings across local government to be made by back-office consolidation, disposing of surplus property and joining up our local public services; we will be discussing with Oxfordshire how this can be taken forward to help protect frontline services.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971552","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405528","internalRevision":"752","internalContentCode":"458370759","publication":"The

Without these protections a democratic, peaceful society is not possible.”</p> <p>Carles Torner, executive director of PEN International, said: “Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the UK is an opportunity … to ensure that the disturbing trend of intolerance towards dissent and criticism in India is raised.”</p> <p> Jo Glanville, executive director of English PEN, added: “Writers in the UK are standing in solidarity with their colleagues in India. There has been an unprecedented wave of protest following ongoing threats to writers in India and the government’s failure to protect freedom of expression in an increasingly hostile climate.”</p> <p> The letter follows an early day motion calling on Cameron to raise human rights with Modi during his visit, signed by more than 40 MPs, while demonstrations are planned outside Downing Street when the Indian prime minister arrives. On Sunday, a sign reading “Modi not welcome” was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/rock-star-reception-visit-indian-prime-minister-narendra-modi\">projected on to the side of the Palace of Westminster.</a></p> <p>Cameron has described Modi’s visit as a “historic opportunity” to foster ties between Britain and India. He said: “It’s an opportunity for two countries, tied by history, people and values, to work together to overcome the biggest challenges of our age.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971168","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405365","internalRevision":"666","internalContentCode":"458369060","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Ahead of the Indian prime minister’s UK visit, hundreds of authors including Salman Rushdie and Ian McEwan urge Cameron to ‘speak out’ on threats to free expression in India","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Narendra Modi visit: authors call for David Cameron to address free speech","byline":"Alison Flood","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T17:08:26Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8d2c9cafc6b9fa5fe6b6b3cc1e42af87c3293ed6/916_718_1231_739/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5643521de4b091de41c2c097","newspaperPageNumber":"1","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-18T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>As Indian prime minister makes UK visit, hundreds of authors including Salman Rushdie and Ian McEwan urge PM to ‘speak out on crucial issue’</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T14:35:09Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T10:01:00.013Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/11/writers-lobby-cameron-to-press-narendra-modi-on-free-speech-issues","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/nov/11/writers-lobby-cameron-to-press-narendra-modi-on-free-speech-issues","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"8d2c9cafc6b9fa5fe6b6b3cc1e42af87c3293ed6","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8d2c9cafc6b9fa5fe6b6b3cc1e42af87c3293ed6/916_718_1231_739/1000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"2015 ChinaFotoPress","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/8d2c9cafc6b9fa5fe6b6b3cc1e42af87c3293ed6","suppliersReference":"554279653","altText":"Narendra Modi.","caption":"‘Unprecedented wave of protest’ ...

It is important that the growing economic ties between India and the UK, which will no doubt be applauded during this visit, should not mask acknowledgment of the darker sides of what’s happening in India today.</p> <p>Since Modi came to power in 2014, minorities and women have experienced rising intolerance and intimidation and cultural and academic freedoms have been eroded. Under his leadership as chief minister of Gujarat in 2002, the Gujarat government watched a pogrom of 1,000 people directed against the minority Muslim community.</p> <p>There has been an escalation of rapes against women and his cabinet includes several ministers against whom criminal cases, including rape, are pending. Modi’s roots and leadership positions in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a belligerent rightwing paramilitary organisation, are well established. The RSS is known for both its misogynist and anti-minority views, and its core Hindu-rule ideology has been publicly endorsed by Modi. Politicians with RSS backgrounds dominate his cabinet and current administration.</p> <p>Under Modi’s rule, inflammatory hate speech and violent acts against Christian and Muslim minorities have steadily increased. Mr Modi’s silence and delayed response to all these crimes does nothing to stem the violence. Additionally, his administration has intimidated environmental and human rights activists and researchers and sought to control key institutions of learning.</p> <p>We support the recent statements by eminent scientists, academics, artists and writers in India who seek to draw attention to growing intolerance in India. In the past year, various freedoms have been attacked, including what people may think, eat, wear and whom they choose to love. Three secular critics have been brutally murdered and these crimes are linked to extreme rightwing groups. In reaction to this, over 70 prominent Indian citizens have returned national awards in protest. While violence against women and minorities in India has existed in the past, never before has the ruling party encouraged an atmosphere where the plural and secular fabric of India has been under such attack.</p> <p>Modi now enjoys immunity as prime minister. What happened in Gujarat in 2002 must not be forgotten and it is important that his official visit to the UK does not give him and his administration a further platform to continue to restrict human rights, tolerance and cultural freedoms in India.<br /><strong>Professor Lyla Mehta</strong><br /><em>Institute of Development Studies, UK</em><br /><strong>Dr Jaideep Gupte</strong><br /><em>Institute of Development Studies, UK</em><br /><strong>Dr Deepta Chopra</strong><br /><em>Institute of Development Studies, UK</em><br /><strong>Dr Anuradha Joshi</strong><br /><em>Institute of Development Studies, UK</em><br /><strong>Dr Dolf te Lintelo</strong><br /><em>Institute of Development Studies, UK</em><br /><strong>Dr Priya Deshingkar</strong><br /><em>University of Sussex</em><br /><strong>Dr Vinita Damodaran</strong><br /><em>University of Sussex</em></p> <p>• Since assuming power in May 2014, Narendra Modi’s government and BJP politicians have created in India an atmosphere of intolerance and hatred that has surpassed the worst expectations of his many critics. There has been an escalation of violence against Dalits, Muslims, Christians and women, including the brutal lynching of a Muslim man in Dadri on suspicion of consuming beef, murders of rationalists and dissenters such as Professor Kalburgi, attacks on tourists, the banning of academic books by Hindu fundamentalists, among many other such incidents. These events represent a direct assault on constitutionally protected freedom of speech and expression, and freedom of religion and belief. Mr Modi’s complicit silence in these horrifying acts bodes ill for the future of India.</p> <p>Mr Modi tours the world extensively as a forward-looking leader focused on India’s economic growth. This is despite agencies such as Moody’s Analytics and papers such as the New York Times warning Mr Modi to rein in his movement’s politics of hatred and violence. It is in the context of trade that Mr Modi is arriving in the UK on 12 November 2015 to meet with British politicians, businessmen and Indian community members. But there has been a sustained undermining by the Modi government of some 13,000 NGOs, including Greenpeace, Amnesty International, ActionAid, Ford Foundation and others working in the areas of environmental justice and human rights. There has been consistent flouting of environmental and resource regulations to serve the interests of the large business houses that Mr Modi has gathered around himself.</p> <p>We urge members of the international community to call attention to Mr Modi’s human rights abuses and to hold him accountable for violations of freedom of speech and religion. For those of us who uphold human rights, Mr Modi is not welcome to the UK.<br /><strong>Dr Subir Sinha</strong><br /><em>SOAS, University of London</em><br /><strong>Dr Rashmi Varma</strong><br

Modi’s career has been tainted with accusations about his role in the appalling Gujarat killings, resulting in the death of more than 2,000 women, men and children from the minority Muslim community. Indeed, this resulted in the implementation of a decade-long major diplomatic boycott of India’s current prime minister – banned from the US, UK and many other western countries.</p> <p>Since becoming PM, Modi has skilfully projected his “cleaner” image with many soundbites on economic development, prosperity and a “digital India” but the reality is that Modi presides over a violent authoritarian regime that seeks to undermine the secular fabric of India, achieving more success in fuelling regional divisions than delivering the real change that swept his party into power.</p> <p>The Sikh nation in India is adding its voice to these provincial uprisings. Recent sacrilegious acts against the Sikh religious scriptures, Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, and the mindless lynching by a Hindu mob of an Indian Muslim citizen rumoured to have eaten beef, have caused widespread outrage. People of faith and none all over India and the globe have united to demand justice against those who are road-blocking the path to freedoms of belief, faith and democracy.</p> <p>Together, the citizens of the United Kingdom, including British Sikhs, have crafted and promoted our shared values of democracy, individual rights, mutual respect and tolerance. The time is now to put our shared values into action and display our commitment to the history, ideals and vision of the United Kingdom.<br /><strong>Charandeep Singh</strong><br /><em>General secretary, Glasgow Gurdwara</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Join the debate – email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>","internalOctopusCode":"10970108","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405385","internalRevision":"30","internalContentCode":"458369230","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Letters:</strong> We urge members of the international community to call attention to Mr Modi’s human rights abuses and to hold him accountable","allowUgc":"false","headline":"On his UK visit, Narendra Modi must be held accountable for his record on human rights in India","byline":"Letters","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T18:00:47Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/11/1447254357010/Indian-Prime-Minister-Nar-001.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5643575fe4b091de41c2c0a6","creationDate":"2015-11-11T14:57:35Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T18:03:57.017Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/on-his-uk-visit-narendra-modi-must-be-held-accountable-for-his-record-on-human-rights-in-india","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/nov/11/on-his-uk-visit-narendra-modi-must-be-held-accountable-for-his-record-on-human-rights-in-india","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"a933d23ce869e8e229a0ee0a4a4cba1ee3001784","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/11/1447254362524/Indian-Prime-Minister-Nar-005.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","picdarUrn":"GD*57228354","suppliersReference":"Del8378469","altText":"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi","caption":"Narendra Modi prepares to address delegates during the India-Africa Forum summit in New Delhi last month.

Between 1969 and 2003 he rode 4,632 winners in Britain – a total exceeded only by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/articles/2005/03/18/sport_heroes_gordon_richards_feature.shtml\">Gordon Richards</a>, with 4,870 ridden between 1921 and 1954. Third in the all-time list in Britain is Lester Piggott, with 4,493 winners. While he could not match Piggott for taciturnity, like his great rival Eddery was a shy, withdrawn sportsman who disliked the limelight.</p> <p>His 14 classic victories in Britain include the Derby three times; he was champion flat jockey in Britain 11 times – the same total as Piggott – and champion on the flat in Ireland in 1982. The first of Eddery’s many winners came on Alvaro at Epsom in April 1969, and less than two months later Eddery won his first major prize, on Sky Rocket in the Wokingham Stakes at Royal Ascot.</p> <p>He finished the 1971 season as champion apprentice with 71 winners, and in 1972 had his first Derby ride – the 50-1 chance Pentland Firth, who finished third behind Roberto and Rheingold – and his first victory in a Group 1 race: Erimo Hawk, awarded the Gold Cup at Ascot on the disqualification of Rock Roi for interference.</p> <p>Despite losing out on that occasion, Rock Roi’s trainer, <a href=\"http://www.lambourntraining.org/trainers/peter-walwyn-chairman-of-the-lta\">Peter Walwyn</a>, had been impressed by the Irishman’s unfussy riding style, and towards the end of the 1972 term offered Eddery the position of stable jockey at what was then one of the most important yards in racing. The arrangement soon brought big-race success. In 1973 Eddery, still only 21, was top jockey at Royal Ascot, while 1974 saw his first winner of an English classic – Polygamy in the Oaks – and his first jockeys’ championship, with 148 winners.</p> <p>Four of those wins came on the Walwyn-trained, two-year-old Grundy, which the following year became the first great horse of Eddery’s career. Though beaten in the 2,000 Guineas, Grundy won the Irish equivalent before producing a brilliant performance to land the Derby decisively.</p> <p>Following victory in the Irish Derby, Grundy and Eddery headed for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot, where an exceptionally high-class field included the five-year-old mare Dahlia, which had won the King George in 1973 and 1974, and the four-year-old Bustino, winner of the St Leger in 1974 and the Coronation Cup earlier in the 1975 season. After a furious pace had been set through the first mile, the race boiled down to a head-to-head duel up the straight between Grundy and Bustino, with the younger horse winning by half a length after a battle that swiftly – and justifiably – became known as “the race of the century”.</p> <p>Eddery remained as stable jockey to Walwyn for eight years, before joining the Irish trainer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jun/02/obituary-vincent-obrien\">Vincent O’Brien</a>, for whom he rode a string of big-race winners, including Golden Fleece, owned by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/apr/09/guardianobituaries.horseracing\">Robert Sangster</a>, in the 1982 Derby.</p> <p>But the same owner–trainer–jockey combination experienced controversial defeat in the Derby two years later, when the unbeaten 2,000 Guineas winner El Gran Senor seemed to be cruising to victory in the final furlong, only to be caught on the line by Secreto, trained by O’Brien’s son David, and beaten by a short head. Eddery was widely criticised by riders in the stand, but insisted that his mount had simply reached the limit of his stamina in the final hundred yards.</p> <p>Happier landmarks in the 1980s included winning the 1983 Arlington Million in Chicago on Tolomeo; the 1985 Breeders’ Cup Turf at <a href=\"https://www.nyra.com/aqueduct/information/history-aqueduct/\">Aqueduct</a>, New York, on Pebbles, trained by Clive Brittain, the first British success in a Breeders’ Cup race; and the 1986 Japan Cup on Jupiter Island, also trained by Brittain.</p> <p>The same decade gave Eddery four victories in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe: on Detroit in 1980, Rainbow Quest in 1985, the great Dancing Brave – on whom he also won the King George – in 1986, and Trempolino in 1987.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnGVCjU_Qa0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnGVCjU_Qa0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Pat Eddery storms to victor on Dancing Brave in 1986</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Rainbow Quest and Dancing Brave were both owned by the Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah, whose <a href=\"http://www.juddmonte.com\">Juddmonte Farms</a> is one of the world’s largest racing and breeding organisations, and in 1987 Eddery became Abdullah’s retained jockey. Highlights of their association, which lasted until 1994, included Quest for Fame winning the 1990 Derby and Zafonic the 1993 2,000 Guineas. Meanwhile, Eddery continued to clock up the jockeys’ championships. His highest seasonal total was 209 in 1990 – the first time a jockey had exceeded 200 since Richards in 1952 – and he was champion for the 11th and final time in 1996.</p> <p>Eddery was born in Dublin and brought up in Newbridge, County Kildare, the fifth of 12 children of Jimmy and Josephine Eddery. Both Jimmy, and Pat’s maternal grandfather, Jack Moylan, were prominent riders – they dead-heated for the Irish 2,000 Guineas in 1944 – and his father finished second in the 1955 Derby on Panaslipper, before winning the Irish Derby on the same horse.</p> <p>At the age of eight, Pat started riding racehorses at the yard of the trainer Seamus McGrath, near Leopardstown racecourse. “I had no fear of horses, even at that age when I was dwarfed by them,” he recalled in his 1992 autobiography, To Be a Champion, “and on horseback I was instilled with a conviction and self-belief I never felt at other times.”</p> <p>On his 14th birthday he was formally apprenticed to McGrath. In his first ride in public he finished last, and he did not win a race until moving to England to complete his apprenticeship with the trainer Herbert “Frenchie” Nicholson, famous for his tutelage of young jockeys.</p> <p>He retired from riding in 2003, and in 2005 took out a licence to train at Musk Hill Stud in Buckinghamshire: Visionist at Kempton Park in April 2006 was his first winner in this new role. But his training career was never in the same league as his riding – his sole Group 1 victory came with Hearts of Fire in the 2009 Gran Criterium at San Siro, Milan – and reached a well-publicised low when Eddery was sued for unfair dismissal by his brother Paul, who had been helping out at Musk Hill. The claim was dismissed.</p> <p>Pat, who was appointed an honorary OBE in 2005, married Carolyn Mercer, the daughter of the flat jockey Manny Mercer, in 1978. They divorced in 2009.</p> <p>He is survived by their two daughters, Nichola, an equestrian artist, and Natasha, and a son, Harry.</p> <p>• Patrick James John Eddery, jockey and racehorse trainer, born 18 March 1952; died 10 November 2015</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10965996","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2404478","internalRevision":"48","internalContentCode":"458361474","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"One of the greatest jockeys of all time who rode more than 4,600 winners and went on to become a trainer","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Pat Eddery obituary","byline":"Sean Magee","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-10T13:54:00Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/10/1447156722693/Pat-Eddery-after-winning--001.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5641db68e4b0f37dd4cb62ae","newspaperPageNumber":"47","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-20T10:39:00Z","standfirst":"<p>One of the greatest jockeys of all time who rode more than 4,600 winners and went on to become a trainer</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-10T11:56:24Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T18:50:22.284Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/10/pat-eddery","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2015/nov/10/pat-eddery","sectionName":"Sport","elements":[{"id":"bc4a52f2a9e1cecf470466695297d9698e5e1512","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/10/1447156727139/Pat-Eddery-after-winning--005.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Pat Eddery after winning the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood on Reel Buddy in 2003.","caption":"Pat Eddery after winning the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood on Reel Buddy in 2003.

Le Soir was seen as a collaborationist newspaper, although Hergé was far from being a Nazi sympathiser, said Farr, who knew the illustrator personally. </p> <p>“The fact was people liked having Tintin in the paper, it cheered people up and it was a great morale booster. It is hard for us to fathom how popular Tintin was.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"24b08b7d6c97e68cd006ca63cec147848affc0a8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/24b08b7d6c97e68cd006ca63cec147848affc0a8/135_0_1572_2362/666.jpg\" alt=\"Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It has been said that Tintin is an alter ego of the young Hergé, while Captain Haddock is a version of the old Hergé.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Hergé Moulinsart 2015</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the war, Tintin became a world superstar <a href=\"http://en.tintin.com/albums\">with the now canonical series of Tintin albums, </a>which contain stories such as Tintin in Tibet, published in the same year the Dalai Lama fled the country. But Captain Haddock, who first appeared in 1941, is the character who always comes top of popularity surveys, said Farr.</p> <p>If Tintin was an alter ego of a young Hergé, a fan of scouting and good deeds, then Haddock was an alter ego of an older Hergé who enjoyed drinking and swore too much. Hergé came up with the name when he asked his wife what fish was she was cooking on night. “Aiglefin,” she said, “or that boring fish they call haddock in English”.</p> <p>Over the years there have been controversies, not least the perceived colonialist racism of books such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/15/tintin-racism-sweden-row\">Tintin in the Congo</a>. Farr said it had not hindered Africa’s enormous enthusiasm for the books, particularly Tintin in the Congo, “a book we feel reservations about more strongly than they do in Africa. He has a universal, very multicultural appeal”.</p> <p>Tintin has also been claimed as a gay icon due to his close relationship with Captain Haddock. Farr is not so sure: “Hergé would be delighted to know he had the pink appeal but knowing Hergé a bit, he loved girls too much, he had an eye for every girl, he would have seen that as the logical thing.”</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/visual-arts/tintin\">Tintin: Hergé’s Masterpiece</a> is at Somerset House in London from 12 November to 31 Jaunuary 2016.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971222","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405362","internalRevision":"2598","internalContentCode":"458369028","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The free show at Somerset House explores the intrepid fictional reporter’s global fame and also examines the Belgian illustrator who created him","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Tintin in London: new exhibition celebrates Hergé's boy wonder","byline":"Mark Brown Arts correspondent","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T19:07:35Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/9cb436b8b13fed450a16001cb146cc782e273c2c/0_777_1856_1112/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56435165e4b0d32696a38fb0","newspaperPageNumber":"9","standfirst":"<p>The free show at Somerset House explores the intrepid fictional reporter’s global fame and also examines the Belgian illustrator who created him</p>","creationDate":"2015-11-11T14:32:05Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-12T11:06:12.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/11/tintin-london-exhibition-celebrates-herges-boy-wonder","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/nov/11/tintin-london-exhibition-celebrates-herges-boy-wonder","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"9cb436b8b13fed450a16001cb146cc782e273c2c","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/9cb436b8b13fed450a16001cb146cc782e273c2c/0_777_1856_1112/1000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/9cb436b8b13fed450a16001cb146cc782e273c2c","altText":"Tintin and his sidekick, Snowy","caption":"Tintin and his sidekick, Snowy, take a break from their adventures.

Brussels at 8.30am last Wednesday, carrying six Syrian and Iraqi families to new lives in Luxembourg. On arrival, the 30 refugees were taken on a two-hour bus trip to the grand duchy to have their paperwork processed.</p> <p>It was undoubtedly a big moment, not only for the men, women and children who made the short but treacherous crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands. Of the more than 600,000 people who have crossed into the EU by reaching Greece this year, these were the first to be registered, fingerprinted and then resettled elsewhere in Europe under the EU’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/eu-governments-divisive-quotas-deal-share-120000-refugees\">ambitious, if flagging, plan</a> to use compulsory quotas to share 160,000 refugees.</p> <p>It took the Luxembourg authorities two months to settle their newcomers. None of those lingering in Greece wanted to move to the EU’s wealthiest country in per capita terms, second globally only to Qatar. Luxembourg currently chairs the EU’s rotating presidency. Jean-Claude Juncker, its prime minister from 1995 to 2013, is head of the European commission and one the architects of the new quota system. So Luxembourg officials were keen to be seen to be doing their bit.</p> <p>“Some of those selected to go to Luxembourg refused, because they all wanted to go to Germany,” Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for immigration, said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32e8c1ec84f646b3c439d1761734dd35eb07e39d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/32e8c1ec84f646b3c439d1761734dd35eb07e39d/172_292_4551_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue at a registration centre after crossing the border between Greece and Macedonia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue at a registration centre after crossing the border between Greece and Macedonia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If refugees are refusing to go to Luxembourg, it will be a much taller order persuading them to go to Slovakia or Estonia.</p> <p>The faltering start in Greece to sharing refugees in Europe highlights the EU’s multiple dilemmas, as leaders meet in Malta on Wednesday and Thursday for their fifth summit since June on the emergency.</p> <p>The confusion, disputes and mudslinging of the past few months have opened up a fundamental question. Do they want a Europe of open or closed borders? The dilemma is embodied in the diametrically opposed policies of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán.</p> <p>Merkel has won international plaudits for her liberal, open-door policies. She is also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/30/merkel-pressure-refugees-germany-talks-government-divided-crisis\">under siege, however, at home</a> from malcontents in her coalition government, in the EU because her partners are not sure what she wants, and by third countries who say they are willing to help but are also baffled by the absence of coherent policy in Berlin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/09/refugee-crisis-viktor-orban-how-does-europe-solve-problem\">Refugee crisis: how does Europe solve a problem like Viktor Orbán?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Orbán, gleefully denouncing liberals as clueless, sealing Hungary’s borders with razorwire and effectively abolishing the claiming of asylum, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/09/refugee-crisis-viktor-orban-how-does-europe-solve-problem\">is walking tall at home </a>because of his hardline policies. He is also increasingly winning the quiet support of other EU leaders.</p> <p>“I don’t say he should be entirely supported,” said a senior diplomat involved in the Malta summit. “But he has a point. There is some truth in what he says. Drastic, restrictive positions would have helped earlier.”</p> <p>The two-day Valletta summit is a lavish event, bringing together more than 60 European and African leaders, with the EU carrying a mixed bag of sticks and carrots, including a €1.8bn “trust fund” in an attempt to cajole African governments into taking migrants back and stopping them from coming to Europe in the first place. Many of them are disenchanted with an EU containment strategy that they feel resembles a form of blackmail.</p> <p>“They say it’s all about Europe externalising and outsourcing its own problems,” said the diplomat, who has been liaising with the African governments.</p> <p>“The Europeans are not exactly visionaries,” another international official taking part in Malta said. “And they don’t realise that they are no longer the centre of the world.”</p> <p>The African meetings are to be followed on Thursday by another emergency EU summit called by Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, who increasingly takes a pro-Orbán line on the crisis.<br /></p> <p>His entourage is predicting that Tusk will push for “drastic and radical action” by the EU, which translates as partial border closures in Europe’s Schengen area, both externally and internally.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/09/on-the-road-in-agadez-desperation-and-death-along-a-saharan-smuggling-route\">On the road in Agadez: desperation and death along a Saharan smuggling route</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given its size and geography, and the number of people involved, Germany is Europe’s shock absorber in the refugee crisis. It is expected to take in a million newcomers this year.</p> <p>At a meeting with Balkan leaders two weeks ago, Merkel was repeatedly asked to clarify her policy. “Many of them did not like that they were summoned by Germany to be told what to do. But the problem is that the Germans don’t know what to do,” said the senior diplomat.</p> <p>The signals from Berlin have been very mixed over the past week. Merkel’s interior and finance ministers, both in the same party, regularly contradict her. On Friday the interior ministry <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/germany-imposes-surprise-curbs-on-syrian-refugees\">announced an abrupt U-turn</a>, saying Syrians would no longer qualify for full asylum in Germany. That was then retracted amid coalition cacophony. On Tuesday, the same ministry said Berlin was ending the open-door policy on Syrians and would now return them to the country where they entered the EU, albeit not Greece.</p> <p>This amounts to a tightening of the German border, with alarming knock-on effects for EU countries such as Croatia and Slovenia, which will only let tens of thousands of migrants in if they are in transit. The same applies to non-EU countries on the Balkan route, such as Serbia and Macedonia.</p> <p>Slovenia on Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/slovenia-fence-refugees-veliki-obrez\">started laying out wire fence</a> along the Slovenian side of the Sutla river that divides the country from Croatia. Prime Minister Miro Cerar has said the border will remain open, but the fence will help control the flow of people.</p> <p>“Merkel was asked if she would close the border, and told the other leaders very clearly ‘I will never do that’,” said another senior EU policymaker. “If you close the German border, you end European integration. You cannot do that.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a21157275ad302c46548dd4e6e47b41050a3e1c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7a21157275ad302c46548dd4e6e47b41050a3e1c/0_124_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People jump off an inflatable raft as they arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos from Turkey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People jump off an inflatable raft as they arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos from Turkey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Merkel, however, is increasingly lonely and embattled. Policymakers say privately that she is looking for a way to back down without losing face. Her open policy is being tightened incrementally. She also wants to strike a deal with Turkey, paying Ankara to police the EU’s external border with Greece, essentially because there is no confidence in Athens’ ability to do it.</p> <p>In the latest policy move, Berlin and Brussels are pressing the transit countries of the Balkans to set up new “processing centres” to screen asylum claimants. It is an admission that the policy of having them finger-printed and registered first in Greece before moving on has failed. Nor do Slovenia, Croatia or Serbia want to register them, however, for fear they will then be saddled with responsibility for the refugees.</p> <p>Avramopoulos sounds bitter and disenchanted. “Schengen is the greatest and most tangible achievement of European integration,” he said. “But some policies are putting Schengen in danger. It’s a difficult moment for Europe. Unfortunately, the European dream has vanished.”</p> <p>The confusion over policy is made worse by the increasingly risible mismatch between what EU leaders say and do. A few weeks ago they promised to send 400 police officers to Slovenia to help with the influx. Only 33 have arrived. Of the 160,000 refugees they agreed to share in September – this is now EU law – 116 have been resettled from Italy and Greece. </p> <p>Months ago they also agreed to share 22,500 refugees taken directly from camps in Turkey and Lebanon. To date 132 Syrians have arrived in Liechtenstein, the Czech Republicand Italy. At every emergency meeting, ministers and leaders call for reinforcements for the EU’s border agency, Frontex. They then fail to supply the staffing, funding and equipment they promised.</p> <p>“Most of these leaders are lost and they’re looking to someone like Tusk to come up with a big idea,” said the senior diplomat. “This is the challenge, because the whole thing can crumble and individual countries will start following Hungary. That won’t help Europe to remain credible.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10971182","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2405248","internalRevision":"899","internalContentCode":"458368125","publication":"The

Photograph: Angela Hampton Picture Library //Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>You turn up for parents’ evening full of questions about your child. But sometimes the teacher seems to mumble or fudge rather than give you a straight reply. Here are truthful answers to some common questions ...</p> <p><strong>I want to ask how my child is doing in relation to her classmates. My question makes teachers look very uncomfortable.</strong> </p> <p>I understand their discomfort. The sense of weighing and measuring one child against others, as opposed to against common standards, can seem like a betrayal of a group of young people whom we teachers also feel a duty of care towards. If I tell you that your child is doing better than Rachel, then I’m telling you how Rachel is doing as well, and you don’t really have a right or need to know that. When pushed, I’ve ventured that a child is in the top/middle/bottom third of the class. However, a better question (being top of a weak class is not necessarily a great achievement) – and the one I ask for my own children – is: “Are they where you’d want them to be at this point?” Teachers will happily tell you whether your child is doing better/similarly/worse than they’d expect, and what appropriate action can be taken.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, what you really want is some sort of gloat-ready statistics that you can post on Facebook about how your child leaves her friends in the dust, then I’ll deliberately spill my cup of tea in your lap while I talk really loudly about her being rock-bottom of the entire school. You sad individual.</p> <p><strong>Why are school reports so formulaic? They say nothing personal about my child. Don’t the teachers know her?</strong></p> <p>Partly this is the inevitable outcome of the bean-counting culture in our education system, where children become numbers on spreadsheets, rather than individuals to be developed. Schools aren’t trying to be distant, but they’ve been told by Ofsted that providing data is how they will be judged, and that parents care only about test results, so that’s what tends to be presented.</p> <p>However, it’s partly a feasibility thing: most secondary school teachers will see hundreds of students each week, often for less than an hour and in the company of 29 other students. So unless your child is really naughty (always the ones whose names are learned first), then it’ll take a while before the teacher can say much about them other than stock phrases based around assessment outcomes. By the way, since you asked, the order in which I learn names is: naughty, ginger, loud, funny, very high/low ability, tall, the rest. If your child is quiet, well-behaved, with brownish hair and of average height, it’s going to take me a little longer ...</p> <p><strong>What do these ‘levels’ mean and what do they tell me about how my child is doing?</strong></p> <p>Levels were initially supposed to give you an idea of how your child was doing at the end of each key stage. So by the end of primary school, most children were expected to be able to be “working at” level 4, and by the end of year 9, most would reach level 5. These were supposed to be approximations reached by teacher judgment considering all their work over the previous year, and based on reasonable expectations of achievement based on the national profile. They were never intended either to be used to mark individual pieces of work, or to provide some sort of measurement of endlessly rising linear progression. Unfortunately, Ofsted’s limitless demands for numbers on spreadsheets have meant that’s exactly how they ended up being used, which led us to all sorts of bonkers places, such as awarding students “sub-levels” (which don’t actually exist in most subjects in secondary school – we have to make them up), and demanding that most children achieve a level by the end of primary school which the original authors of levels thought would not be achieved by the majority of children even at the end of year 9.</p> <p>Throw in the new performance-related pay system, in which teachers are told their careers depend on ensuring that all children hit inflated “aspirational” targets based on these non-existent sub-levels, and you’ll understand why the abolition of levels last year was one of the few things Michael Gove did which didn’t arouse universal derision. Unfortunately, he didn’t replace levels with anything sensible or useful, but simply instructed schools to make up their own assessment systems. So levels may have been misused and inaccurate, but compared to the smorgasbord of half-baked individual measurement systems on the way, they were the essence of clarity.</p> <p><strong>Why hasn’t my son reached his target level in some subjects, when he works really hard and is very bright?</strong></p> <p>As explained above, targets are often pretty meaningless, and their purpose is more to beat teachers and schools than to help your son. Nevertheless, if there’s an assessment, then the teacher should be able to explain how it was marked, and why the result went one way as opposed to another (whatever measurement system is used). In your case, I’d listen, as given that the teacher’s pay is probably dependent upon your son hitting whatever target has been spat out of the school’s “aspirational” spreadsheets, the fact that he’s still been marked as missing it suggests he has an honest teacher who’ll be able to give you decent feedback.</p> <p><strong>My son is constantly being praised for ‘teaching the other children’ or ‘helping people with their maths’? Is he doing your job for you? </strong></p> <p><strong>Why must my daughter do all this group work? She always gets mixed in with children who can’t be bothered, and she ends up doing all the work.</strong></p> <p>I was a bright kid often asked to help others, and I, too, was peeved at school when I was having to carry the load for the group while Alice fiddled with her hair and Kathryn drew rude pictures on Tom’s book. However, there is a lot of pretty convincing evidence that one of the best ways to secure and improve both knowledge and understanding is not to receive it from others, but to deliver it to others. So in situations where children are helping other children learn, they are almost certainly learning more themselves than if they were passively receiving instruction from the teacher. So, while it may seem annoying at the time, feel free to come back and compare exam results with the freeloaders in a year or two, and see if you’re still miffed about your child having to do the group’s presentation on the similarities between the Stasi and Ofsted on their own.</p> <p><strong> I reported a boy for bullying and although the school seemed to take it seriously I never heard the outcome. Why not? </strong></p> <p>Schools do take bullying very seriously. If unaddressed it can escalate in the classroom, even though much of it now takes place outside school, particularly online. It is a very difficult situation because often it’s a “he-said-she-said” situation with little, or no, hard evidence. Nevertheless, even without evidence, action will usually be taken to reduce contact between protagonists, and a watchful eye will be kept. Remember that just because you didn’t hear about an outcome doesn’t mean there wasn’t one. It’s important to bear in mind that both parties in a bullying situation are children, and often bullying results from a difficult background situation for the bully, and so it wouldn’t be appropriate for the school to share details with the parent of another child. I know that can be frustrating, but the issue to focus on is whether the bullying stops, not whether revenge has been duly visited on the bully.</p> <p>• The writer is a history teacher and blogs under the name of Disappointed Idealist (<a href=\"http://disidealist.wordpress.com/\">http://disidealist.wordpress.com</a>)</p> <h2>Teachers Translated: what they say and what they mean</h2> <p><strong>Primary schools</strong></p> <p><strong>1 ‘So, how do you think she’s settled in?’</strong></p> <p>Parents always react to this as if I were making idle chitchat. But it’s actually important to me and I need an honest response. If your child is showing any signs of unhappiness at all, hopefully there is time for us to get to the bottom of it so that a) we can make her happy again and b) her learning won’t be impeded.</p> <p><strong>2 ‘She’s quite a character’</strong></p> <p>Even the most stone-hearted teacher loves to have lively children in their class, but if a teacher makes this sort of comment it might be that your child is sending out worrying signals. Could she be crying out for attention and, if so, why? Is she parked in front of a screen for most of the time at home to keep her quiet or occupied? If so, it’s little wonder that she may want an audience when that screen isn’t around. While getting laughs from her peers might make her feel good, it won’t help her learning. It might be time to limit the screen time and have a few conversations in which you listen to her.</p> <p><strong>3 ‘I’d like to see him contribute more to class discussion.’</strong></p> <p>Some children genuinely lack self-confidence. If this is the case I’ll tell you so in a heartbeat, and we could discuss a few strategies to build his self-esteem or speaking skills. Some children, on the other hand, don’t lack confidence in class yet for some reason they choose to sit and watch others put up their hands in discussion. If I use this phrase, it’s because he’s a bright kid, and I think he – and the rest of the class – would benefit from him sharing his ideas more readily. It would be great if we could both encourage him to do so, and shower him with praise when he does.</p> <p><strong>4 ‘He needs to take more responsibility for his own learning.’</strong></p> <p>I’m telling you, regretfully, that he’s bone idle. Could it be that he is is too used to having everything done for him at home? If he can’t think for himself, he’ll be in for a major shock at secondary school. He needs to learn responsibility, and fast; a few chores around the house in exchange for his weekly pocket money would be a good way to support this at home.</p> <p><strong>Secondary and FE</strong></p> <p><strong>5. ‘His written work is inconsistent.’ </strong></p> <p>Your son’s arts course isn’t just painting, acting and drama games. He needs to put hard hours in on the theory as well as the practical stuff, because written work will count for just as much when it comes to his final grade. Unless he starts taking this side of things seriously, he’ll end up losing that university place to somebody else who does. It would be great if you could join me in reminding him of this as often as I seem to be doing.</p> <p><strong>6 ‘This subject doesn’t come naturally to him/her …’</strong></p> <p>See also: <strong>‘Needs to apply herself a little bit more.’ </strong></p> <p>To be blunt, he’s going to fail unless he pulls his finger out. We can discuss a variety of intervention strategies and extra revision, but I really need you to limit the X-Box. Coming up with a structured work/play timetable nailed to the fridge at home – particularly in the run-up to exam time – would be a good start.</p> <p><strong>7 </strong>(to child at parents’ evening) <strong>‘How do you think you are getting on? Tell me about your progress this year.’</strong></p> <p>Sorry. It’s nothing personal, but I’ve been sitting in this chair for the past three hours, and I physically can’t talk any more.</p> <p><strong>Other phrases translated:</strong></p> <p><strong>‘When you apply yourself you can create some really good work’</strong></p> <p><strong>Translation:</strong> Timmy needs to knuckle down and work harder.</p> <p><strong>‘Can be a little chatty’ </strong></p> <p><strong>Translation: </strong>REALLY disruptive.</p> <p><strong>‘Please remind me what time your appointment is?’ </strong></p> <p><strong>Translation:</strong> I have absolutely no idea who you are or what your child is called.</p> <p>By @Super_Work</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9721359","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-09T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2204817","internalContentCode":"453131636","internalRevision":"26","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Some honest replies to the issues that seem to make teachers squirm.

Photograph: Handout/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>In the 1860s when the Austrian ambassador complained to the home secretary, Sir George Grey, about Karl Marx and other revolutionaries, he received a brief and dismissive reply: “Under our laws, mere discussion of regicide, so long as it does not concern the Queen of England and so long as there is no definite plan, does not constitute sufficient grounds for the arrest of the conspirators.”</p> <p>Not quite what the current home secretary would have replied, I suspect. Theresa May is rushing yet another terrorism bill through parliament. This will place a legal duty on universities to ban radical speakers – “mere discussion” in the words of her Liberal predecessor, who probably also took a more favourable view of being labelled “radical”.</p> <p>Fifty years ago Malcolm X came to speak in Oxford, an episode now recalled to stir the sentimental memories of the university’s alumni. Today, of course, he would never have made it to Oxford; the UK Border Agency would have turned him back at Heathrow. After all even the very silly, but vile, Julien Blanc, the seducers’ guru, has been banned.</p> <p>Malcolm X would probably have fared better in his homeland. The United States remains a nation of laws girded by a constitution, despite police shootings and protest riots. Sadly the United Kingdom is rapidly becoming a nation of ministerial discretion and direction, ever wider administrative powers that would probably have more than satisfied the 19th-century Prussian and Austrian bureaucrats who were so worried about Marx.</p> <p>Under May’s new legislation, universities will have to follow the “guidance” issued by the Home Office. If they fail to follow it, the home secretary will be able to issue them with “directions”. Far from being regarded as institutions in which the most vigorous (and contested) debates should be encouraged, higher education institutions are now to be treated as fertile ground for the “radicalisation” of gullible students by supporters of “extremism”.</p> <p>This is not the first time the government has introduced legislation to require universities to ban “extremist” speakers, although paradoxically the first political intervention back in the 1980s was to stop universities, and student unions, banning rightwing speakers, extremists of another ilk.</p> <p>But this initial, and rather one-sided, libertarianism was quickly succeeded by more authoritarian interventions. Until now, the centrepiece has been the “Prevent” strategy, begun under Labour and revamped by the current government.</p> <p>The 2011 white paper asserted the government’s “absolute commitment to defending freedom of speech”. But, in the very next sentence, it argued that preventing terrorism meant that “extremist (but non-violent) views” had to be “challenged” – by the administrative measures it then outlined. We have travelled a long road from Grey’s reply to the ambassador.</p> <p>There is so much wrong with the new legislation. The key terms such as radicalisation, extremism and terrorism will be defined by politicians who are advised by securitocrats, cowed by tabloid-inflamed public opinion and influenced by electoral advantage.</p> <p>These definitions will not only, and inevitably, be politicised but are also likely to be expandable and open-ended. Those who express their opposition to UK interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and now Syria, possibly in ill-judged rhetorical language, could well be caught in the net.</p> <p>Mission drift is also inevitable. Previous anti-terrorist legislation has been used to spy on parents who might be mis-reporting their home addresses to get their children into popular schools. Botched, but costly, spying on environmental protesters has also been justified under legislation that clearly had entirely different intentions.</p> <p>But the major objection is two-fold. First, academic freedom, like freedom of speech, is not something to be name-checked and then undermined. It is a fundamental principle, not because ivory-tower dons deserve to be indulged but because free universities are an essential component of a free society. The free expression of even the most detestable views should only be curbed by the most precise necessity – back to Grey’s Whiggish formula.</p> <p>In the case of universities, there is an extra argument. If the war on terror has demonstrated anything, it has shown how little we in the west understand the feelings of others, or know about the countries we have invaded/liberated. To risk curbing that understanding and knowledge by discouraging the engagement and dialogue required by scholars and researchers seems perverse.</p> <p>Second, banning “extremist” speakers is a counsel of despair. It accepts that such views are so seductive that they can only be suppressed. There is no confidence that, in the battle of ideas, values of openness, tolerance and liberty – those much lauded “British” values – will triumph, so we must be closed, intolerant and authoritarian (rather like the extremists we seek to oppose?).</p> <p>Sadly higher education leaders, with their default pro-establishment setting, will not make these arguments – or only behind closed doors. May and her successors are unlikely to have to issue any “directions” to universities because her “guidance” will be so closely followed. In England, even amid this “clash of civilisations”, discreet pragmatism will always take precedence over open and principled debate.</p> <p>Peter Scott is professor of higher education studies, Institute of Education</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9812089","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2200163","internalContentCode":"452709709","internalRevision":"10","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"By forcing universities – the home of vigorous debate – to ban radical speakers we are adopting closed, intolerant values, says <strong>Peter Scott</strong>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Anti-terror measures will make us the ‘extremists’ we fear","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Peter Scott","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-02T06:59:08.482Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417099954728/Theresa-May-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54773824e4b08fbd11e1b0f9","newspaperPageNumber":"41","internalStoryPackageCode":"82755","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T06:59:08Z","standfirst":"By forcing universities – the home of vigorous debate – to ban radical speakers we are adopting closed, intolerant values","linkText":"Anti-terror measures will make us the ‘extremists’ we fear | Peter Scott","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-02T06:59:08.482Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/02/anti-terror-measures-make-us-extremists","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/dec/02/anti-terror-measures-make-us-extremists","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"11960f34cec55efea284972289290d77257aba81","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417099961102/Theresa-May-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"REUTERS","picdarUrn":"GD*48439517","suppliersReference":"LON002","altText":"Theresa May","caption":"Theresa May is pushing a terrorism bill through parliament which will place a legal duty on universities to ban radical speakers.

Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Dear Nicky Morgan</p> <p>In 2011, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-at-munich-security-conference\" title=\"\">prime minister said</a>: “Under the doctrine of state multiculturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream. We’ve failed to provide a vision of society to which they feel they want to belong.”</p> <p>Though David Cameron used the word “state” in front of “multiculturalism”, his speech was widely reported as telling us that it was the bit about living our “different cultures” that had been a disaster. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12371994\" title=\"\">Laura Kuenssberg on the BBC website wrote</a>: “In frank language he made abundantly clear he believes multiculturalism has failed.”</p> <p>At the time, I didn’t hear anyone in government rushing to correct any ambiguity around what the prime minister actually said. The “vision” that teachers should “provide” has turned out to be the “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/09/michael-gove-british-values-curriculum\" title=\"\">basic British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance for those of different faiths and beliefs</a>”.</p> <p>I guess we’re supposed to lay to one side the fact that these owe plenty to universalist ideas originating in France, the US and the United Nations rather than to something specifically British. The message I get here is that in education, we don’t need to bother about being historically accurate. Or is talking about “values” in a universal way in itself dangerously multicultural?</p> <p>Cameron’s speech came early on in this government. Subsequently, we’ve been offered free schools. People like me have opposed these on the grounds that they get in the way of providing the same educational opportunities to all children and can lead to the absurd situation I heard played out on Radio 4’s Today programme in which a local authority is accused of not intervening in so-called problem schools over which it has no control – as has happened in Tower Hamlets recently. How handy for you that it wasn’t you being grilled by the interviewer. And yet, in your government’s rush to create schools controlled by your office, it’s your office that encourages “state multiculturalism”, which according to Cameron leads to us having “separate lives”, and can result in “Islamist extremism” and “terrorism”.</p> <p>I nipped over to the “<a href=\"http://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/what-are-free-schools/find-a-free-school\" title=\"\">Find a free school near you</a>” page at the New Schools Network site and found more than 30 schools which appear to provide a culturally specific faith ethos, whether that’s dubbed Islamic, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, Hindu, Christian, Church of England or Catholic.</p> <p>I fully concede that this is a guess – and people will correct me if I’m wrong – but I doubt if there are many Muslims in the Jewish schools on this list, nor let’s say, many Catholics in the Hindu schools, or Jews in the Hindu schools … and so on. Doesn’t that encourage people to lead “separate lives”? When people set up free schools with a faith name on the board outside, don’t they tend to give off a signal about who’s welcome to come inside? Why else set them up?</p> <p>I gather that these days, I’m what’s known as “ethnically Jewish”. I could set up an “ethnically Jewish” school, couldn’t I? I could agree to abide by all the conditions on your website; on the board outside my school I could write “The Michael Rosen Ethnically Jewish School”. If I set this up in north London, say, I can imagine that it might attract a few parents.</p> <p>And what would I have achieved? I would have pulled some children out of schools where they had mixed with children of many faiths, no faith, many cultures and mixed cultures. Ofsted would of course pop in to make sure I was teaching “British values” so I would take care to not call them “universal”. Likewise, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11253436/Ofsted-rural-schools-failing-to-promote-British-values.html\" title=\"\">as Ofsted have instructed some rural schools recently</a>, I’d have to teach “diversity” even as we were practising the opposite.</p> <p>As I thought some more about my ethnically Jewish school, I wondered what kind of encouragement would the state give me, even though Cameron has warned me of the dangers of this? This time I nipped over to the government’s own website to see what kind of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/326402/201407v3_Single_FA_mainstream_published.pdf\" title=\"\">financial assistance</a> I might expect from your office.</p> <p>Here I learned that: “The secretary of state will pay grants towards recurrent expenditure and may pay grants towards capital expenditure” for my free school. Recurrent expenditure “means any money spent on the establishment, conduct, administration and maintenance” of my school, apart from the  capital expenditure which means expenditure on such things as: “acquiring land and buildings”; and “such other items … of a substantial or enduring nature which the secretary of state agrees are capital expenditure...” This may also include “funding for any other costs to the academy [or free school] which the secretary of state considers necessary”.</p> <p>That’s quite a lot of “encouragement”. Cameron should be told.</p> <p><strong>Yours, Michael Rosen</strong></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9818557","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2200709","internalContentCode":"452751518","internalRevision":"7","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The PM is worried about different cultures living apart from each other, but more free schools of specific faiths isn’t going to help","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Dear Ms Morgan: how do faith schools tackle the problem of ‘separate lives’?","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Michael Rosen","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-02T07:09:08.676Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/28/1417177821575/Faith-schools-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"547867c7e4b0c45a9ee684fe","newspaperPageNumber":"42","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T07:09:08Z","standfirst":"The PM is worried about different cultures living apart from each other, but more free schools of specific faiths isn’t going to help","linkText":"Dear Ms Morgan: how do faith schools tackle the problem of ‘separate lives’? | Michael Rosen","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-03T00:03:42.000Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/02/faith-schools-not-tackle-problem-separate-lives","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/dec/02/faith-schools-not-tackle-problem-separate-lives","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"e45b98e75effaa0c934931b24bc4281d1207c243","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/28/1417177828331/Faith-schools-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"The Guardian","picdarUrn":"GD*8876122","altText":"Faith schools","caption":"'I could set up an \"ethnically Jewish\" school … And what would I have achieved?

The police and local authority had briefed secondary headteachers twice in preparation this term. For those of us who’d been paying attention to the local press, we had read of a large number of men being arrested and charged nearly a year ago. Last week, 13 men were convicted of systematic sexual abuse, and 49 other individuals are now being investigated. But while we’ve been waiting for the trials to end, it has hardly been quiet in our own schools. Child sex exploitation on such a large, organised scale is shocking and rare, but we spend too many of our days working with devastating individual cases that don’t draw as much attention.</p> <p>Every week another child protection case comes to light at my school. Sadly, the children do not always perceive themselves to be victims and therefore referrals to the police can sometimes lead nowhere. A year-9 girl returned from a few weeks’ absence and regaled her PSHE class with details about her work as a prostitute. When we expressed concern, she simply told us not to worry: no one slapped her around; she could look after herself.</p> <p>A year-11 boy in similar circumstances reassured us that men couldn’t be prostitutes, he was just helping his mum with the rent and she knew all about it.</p> <p>These are extreme examples but there are more children being exploited every day. Waiting for Operation Brooke, as it was called, to become public meant everyone would stop and point at Bristol for a while. But it is more complex than that.</p> <p>We were fairly confident that none of our current or ex-students were among the victims in these cases, but in a city as small as Bristol the associations will ripple out to most schools. It could so easily have been one of our children: we can tick off the at-risk factors for so many. We have children who are looked-after and in care. Some of our students attend a pupil referral unit (PRU), where they meet other vulnerable children. Sometimes I need to exclude a student for a fixed period. Parents do not always keep them at home for these days, so where are they? I am very aware that when I make a decision about a child, such as sending them to a PRU, I may risk making that child even more vulnerable. But there are simply not enough alternatives on offer to me as a headteacher.</p> <p>Of course, I always report every incident to the police if appropriate; we also report things to social services. But the thresholds for them to take action are high, and getting higher.</p> <p>Every week I become aware that another of my students has made and distributed an indecent image of a child. Usually it’s a girl who has taken a naked photo of herself and sent it to someone she trusted. The now ex-boyfriend has shown his friends, or her friend has found it and put it on Facebook as a joke. Each time the fallout is incredible for these children, but the police are not really interested. And unless there was coercion involved, social services may not be able to help either.</p> <p>I’ve sat in meetings with parents who have joked it off, said that it is “just one of those things”. I’ve even heard them say: “If Facebook had been around when I was 13, I’d have been doing the same.”</p> <p>There is simply not enough support for my staff to help vulnerable children, let alone try to educate them. Referrals to Early Help can take weeks; a referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) months; educational psychologists are overworked. If something happens and I need some immediate support – imagine a girl is raped, or a boy watches his mother beaten up – it can take for ever. We can offer sympathy, comfort, somewhere to cry, but we are not specialists and I worry that we might do more damage without realising it. It comes down to a few charities helping out as much as they can – and their caseloads are heaving. In Bristol, they will be even heavier now.</p> <p>It’s far too easy to think that all victims are girls in care. But the behaviours they often demonstrate in care may have been learned in abusive families – sometimes they are being prostituted by their own relatives and therefore have an altered concept of what is right and wrong. More needs to be done, far earlier, to prevent such behaviours becoming normal.</p> <p>Taking children away is usually too little too late, and you have to know that the abuse is there. Schools are a universal service, and sustained and robust education could do a great deal. A couple of lessons a year on respectful relationships will do nothing to counter what is happening at home.</p> <p>Even before it finished, the Bristol trial had already created problems. Last week, one of my students reacted violently against a friend who had called her mum a name. The insult about her mother was a racial slur linked directly to Operation Brooke. Just over a year ago this girl’s mum had died; she’d been coerced into prostitution by a boyfriend who’d also introduced her to drugs. The end was tragic.</p> <p>What was I to do about the girl’s outburst? I could internally exclude her – but she was in an internal exclusion when this happened. I called home and her grandmother came to get her. But within an hour, Grandma called to say she had run away to meet friends in town. I’ve no idea how to help this girl – she refuses counselling or any other support. Just as she was settling back into a new kind of normal, this happens.</p> <p>She is not alone. The shocking headlines open old wounds for many children. There are children, and adults, all across Bristol who are reeling this week. Multiply that across Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford …</p> <p>One of the greatest strains on us now in school is a breakdown in race relations. Some parts of Bristol are very multicultural, but other areas – like mine – are steadfastly white and working class. There are EDL flags in windows. Racist language is common, along with sexism and homophobia. We are on a constant crusade to develop inclusivity and tolerance and to combat ingrained rage.</p> <p>Nearly 40% of our families have neither parent working; 15% have never worked; we have twice as many children on free school meals as those who pay. Most of our children have never been into the centre of Bristol, let alone been on a holiday. For many of these children, all of whose consciousness is post-2001, anyone different from them is a terrorist, an illegal immigrant, a job-stealer or a sex attacker. I have spent the last month redoubling our focus on combating racism in preparation for the Operation Brooke verdict.</p> <p>The executive summary in the Rotherham inquiry identified some professionals not wanting to target Asian men as predators for fear of being racist; my own fear about the racist response to Operation Brooke has already been realised. It is perhaps this aspect that is hardest to deal with. The convicted men are, as a point of fact, of Somalian heritage. We know that does not mean that all Somalian men are sex offenders, but some of the children – and some of their parents – are struggling with this. One morning recently, while waiting for his bus to work, one of my teachers was spat at and called a “Paedo”. He doesn’t live that far from the school.</p> <p>Our jobs are already extremely difficult. Every day we are dealing with smaller one-off cases and struggling to keep our heads above water. I don’t have enough staff; I don’t have enough money, or time, or options available to make a difference.</p> <p>We need small off-site units that students can go to for both education and emotional or lifestyle support. I’d like more one-to-one mentors to work with children in school and at home. We need more access to different types of therapies because one size does not fit all. We need more family workers supporting children and parents from an earlier age.</p> <p>Our communities are struggling and a case on this scale simply makes things harder for us all. I dread to think what else is out there.</p> <p>The author is a headteacher in Bristol</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9759882","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2196827","internalContentCode":"452363907","internalRevision":"14","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"After the Bristol case, a local head explains how widespread the issue is and how few resources there are to help affected pupils","allowUgc":"false","headline":"‘Schools can’t cope with the tide of child sexual exploitation’","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"A Bristol headteacher","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-02T07:30:09.152Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417107008142/Child-sex-exploitation-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"546f3b62e4b08a4e6205ae5d","newspaperPageNumber":"40","internalStoryPackageCode":"82645","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T07:30:15Z","standfirst":"After the Bristol case, a local head explains how widespread the issue is and how few resources there are to help affected pupils","linkText":"‘Schools can’t cope with the tide of child sexual exploitation’","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-03T00:03:42.000Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/02/schools-cant-cope-child-sexual-exploitation-schools-bristol-headteacher","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/dec/02/schools-cant-cope-child-sexual-exploitation-schools-bristol-headteacher","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"f4faa7558615e9f7ba5a9122d418682d568d4237","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417107013430/Child-sex-exploitation-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Alamy","picdarUrn":"GD*48534037","suppliersReference":"ACJ094","altText":"Child sex exploitation","caption":"'Sometimes I need to exclude a student for a fixed period.

It plans to spend a further £75,000 on bus transport and £13,500 on taxis this academic year. The figures are revealed in documents on the school’s website.</p> <p>The school is part of the troubled E-Act chain, which this year was stripped of 10 of its schools following government concerns about standards.</p> <p>The document shows that in the 2012-13 academic year the school spent £20,750, or 8% of its £261,202 pupil premium funding, on transporting pupils by bus, and a further £8,682 on funding for students with “individual transport issues” getting to school, “coach costs for tours of the new academy to ensure smooth transition” and transport costs for a sports day held at Manchester’s Sportcity stadium.</p> <p>The transport funding is a legacy of the academy moving a mile from the site of its predecessor secondary, Grange school, in April 2013.</p> <p>A source close to the school, where 71% of pupils are eligible for pupil premium funding, says the cash should have been spent supporting children directly in the classroom.</p> <p>We do wonder whether the Education Funding Agency, which distributes academy funding, might take a view on whether this is an effective use of the pupil premium.</p> <p>In a statement, E-Act says: “The academy chose to provide daily transport for the most vulnerable students to ensure that punctuality and attendance would remain at a high level. Using pupil premium funding to support that is entirely appropriate.” E-Act also highlights a high recent pupil attendance rate and Ofsted stating that its free schools meals pupils performed well relative to their peers.</p> <h2>Anger over council leak of inspection report</h2> <p>Parents at a primary school in the Thames Valley are furious after a senior council officer publicly released its “special measures” judgment from an Ofsted inspection before the report had been published.</p> <p>Alison Alexander, director of children’s services for the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, sent a message detailing the verdict in a “reply to all” response to parents, many of whom have been campaigning to save the school from being forced into academy status. The parents have been copying in journalists and politicians on their emails to Alexander.</p> <p>At the time of Alexander’s email concerning Bisham Church of England primary school, near Marlowe in Buckinghamshire, parents had not been informed of the Ofsted report results. Her email came nearly a week before the official publication. <a href=\"http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/11602637.Marlow_school_in_special_measures_after__inadequate__Ofsted_controversy/\" title=\"\">The Bucks Free Press ran a story on the verdict the following day</a>.</p> <p>Parent campaigners are now fearful that the school could lose its headteacher of 28 years, Jim Cooke, despite a string of previous good Ofsted reports.</p> <p>Alexander tells us: “The moment the Ofsted report is sent to the school as well as the local authority … it is no longer confidential.” The local authority is now using formal intervention powers to improve standards, she adds, somewhat ominously for the campaigners.</p> <h2>Haringey NUT call off strike action</h2> <p>The National Union of Teachers has called off strike action in Haringey, north London, which arose after the suspension of union rep Julie Davies.</p> <p>To the fury of the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2830709/Union-PAYING-teachers-strike-Parents-outrage-NUT-bankrolls-walkouts-official-hasn-t-taught-14-years.html\" title=\"\">Daily Mail, which put the story on its front page two weeks ago,</a> two secondary schools were partially closed for three days this month. NUT members had walked out in support of Davies in a dispute over letters sent by groups of secondary and primary headteachers about her work.</p> <p>The secondary heads had suggested their schools would no longer pay for Davies’s working time while she was in post. The union said it would not be told by heads who its representative could be, although the heads denied they were trying to veto NUT members’ choice.</p> <p>Now the NUT says headteachers have agreed to back a proposal that the local schools forum, on which they are represented, would pay into a fund which will continue to support the work of all local union reps, whoever they are. It sounds like relief all round, though we will keep a watching brief on this story.</p> <h2>Ofsted plays down website row with DfE</h2> <p>An impending move to close down Ofsted’s dedicated website provoked a little-noticed row between the inspectorate and the Department for Education, we have discovered.</p> <p>Ofsted is to have all of its online content – including inspection reports on schools across England – transferred to the government’s overarching website, “gov.uk”, by the end of the year.</p> <p>An Ofsted spokesman seemed enthusiastic this month about the move, <a href=\" http://academiesweek.co.uk/no-link-left-behind-for-edu-watchdogs-website-move/\" title=\"\">saying</a>: “The gov.uk portal brings more than 300 public services together under a single web address, making it simpler, clearer and easier for users to find the information they need.”</p> <p>However, minutes of an Ofsted board paper from last December paint a different picture. They say: “Ofsted is currently formally contesting the earlier decision by the Government Digital Service (GDS) not to grant the organisation an exemption from the transition of government digital content to the single gov.uk platform in 2014.”</p> <p>An Ofsted spokeswoman confirmed last week that “initial concerns [from Ofsted] related to the control over content published to the site” but added that the issue had been resolved.</p> <p>She said: “Having sought assurances that Ofsted would retain control over the content published on the site, including all our published reports, we were satisfied that a move to gov.uk would in no way compromise our independence.”</p> <p>Fair enough, but this does look like another behind-the-scenes contretemps between the DfE and the schools watchdog over the latter’s independence, with the two sides at odds a few times this year.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9792261","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2197069","internalContentCode":"452381111","internalRevision":"10","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Oldham school spent £15k on taxis for pupils; anger over inspection report leak; peace breaks out in Haringey and Ofsted plays down website row","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Academy spends pupil premium cash on taxis and buses","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Warwick Mansell","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-11-25T07:00:06.711Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416591702939/Taxi-sign-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"546f78a1e4b0f48993abc86a","newspaperPageNumber":"39","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-28T07:00:06Z","standfirst":"Oldham school spent £15k on taxis for pupils; anger over inspection report leak; peace breaks out in Haringey and Ofsted plays down website row","linkText":"Academy spends pupil premium cash on taxis and buses","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-25T07:00:06.711Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/25/academy-spends-pupil-premium-funding-buses-taxis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/nov/25/academy-spends-pupil-premium-funding-buses-taxis","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"149b231f70c37f801ff833cf2ca7ef577e622b06","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416591709630/Taxi-sign-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"The Guardian","picdarUrn":"GD*12090980","altText":"Taxi sign","caption":"The Oldham Academy North plans to spend another £13,500 on taxis for pupils in this school year.

Senior figures say that some vice-chancellors have been choosing to retire early – while others are being pushed. The new business ethos inside higher education means university leaders are expected to deliver results and be able to show it.</p> <p>Their plight will not be met with sympathy from all quarters. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/10/universities-vice-chancellors-ministers-pay-budget-cut\">Ministers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jan/02/vice-chancellor-wage-increase-angers-students-unions\">rank-and-file academics and students</a> have all expressed anger about escalating “fatcat” salaries for university leaders, against the backdrop of a public sector pay freeze.</p> <p>Prof Michael Shattock, visiting professor of higher education at the Institute of Education and author of a recent book on good university governance, says that university boards are now subjecting management teams to corporate-style appraisals. “Governing bodies are a good deal more forceful than they used to be, and VCs are a lot more vulnerable than in the past,” he says. “A lot of universities are quite unhappy places at the top.”</p> <p>Dr David Palfreyman, bursar of New College Oxford, says: “Vice-chancellors are being unceremoniously dumped, albeit doubtless with golden parachutes, and this fits with them demanding ever more money over the past decade on the alleged basis that they are dynamic CEOs of mega-enterprises.”</p> <p>And Matt Robb – managing director of Parthenon, a management consultancy that has given strategic advice to universities – agrees: “The market is gradually exposing the failings of universities’ business models, and putting them under a lot of pressure. Some vice-chancellors are responding sensibly, and others idiotically. One problem is that few boards really know enough about how universities work to understand the difference.”</p> <p>Political battles within universities are typically fought quietly, but a recent acrimonious dispute between Wendy Purcell, vice-chancellor of Plymouth University, and her then chair of governors, Judge William Taylor, has rocked the university and the city.</p> <p>Purcell was suspended from her £288,000-a-year post by Taylor in July, following complaints about her conduct. The university has declined to release details about the concerns, or the findings of the inquiry that followed her suspension. Meanwhile Taylor resigned at the end of September following allegations of sexual harassment – which he vigorously denies.</p> <p>Purcell returned to the university on 10 November – and in name she remains vice-chancellor. But Plymouth has confirmed that her deputy, Prof David Coslett, will be in charge of running the university as interim chief executive, a role he took on in her absence. Purcell will have a much smaller portfolio, concentrating on external relations and business engagement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0d37d8e96d0c31540d7630ebfffdf1da75487bc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/21/1416595018774/45f83ab0-33b9-431c-86df-3df9bdc5f72b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wendy Purcell returned to Plymouth University on 10 November but with a much reduced role.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wendy Purcell returned to Plymouth University on 10 November but with a much reduced role.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strikingly, the senior management section of Plymouth’s website no longer includes any mention of Purcell. And senior figures close to the university say that her return is the first stage in a negotiated exit plan. Purcell declined to comment on her change of role.</p> <p>Last week Plymouth’s new chair, James Brent, and Coslett told the Guardian that they were determined to put this conflict behind them. “But that doesn’t mean forgetting about the past,” Coslett says. “We want to learn from our experiences. We will look at our systems of governance and develop and improve them. Our recent experience has made us want to be even more ambitious and an exemplar of good governance for the sector.”</p> <p>Brent, an entrepreneur and chair of Plymouth Argyle football club, says: “It is very important that the organisation has a clear focus on what success looks like. There should be no difference between the board and the executive on that shared view.” He says he is prepared to challenge the senior management team, “but only to improve the organisation”. Both he and Coslett say they are building a new culture of “confidence and trust” in the university. “If it is a relationship of policeman and policed that is not an effective board,” Brent adds.</p> <p>The battle at Plymouth may have been unusually public, but senior academics say this is far from the only example of tensions at the top. The vice-chancellor of one research university says: “If you look at the recent vice-chancellor departures, a lot of them are linked to problems in the institution. In other words, they have been pushed.”</p> <p>There have been some unexpected resignations in recent months, though it is difficult to say if they are due to tensions between boards and their university figureheads. Prof Chris Higgins sparked surprise when he announced in March that he would retire from his £244,000-a-year post as vice-chancellor of Durham University in September. The university, like any forward-looking organisation, he said “needs an injection of new ideas and energy from the top”.</p> <p>In a formal statement at the time the chair of the university council, Robert Gillespie, said that Higgins had told him “some months ago” that he wanted to retire. He confirmed that Higgins would “relinquish all his executive responsibilities” at the end of September, but retain an emeritus role looking after external relations. His deputy has now stepped in as acting vice-chancellor.</p> <p>Last week Southampton University began advertising for a new vice-chancellor. Prof Don Nutbeam announced in July that he intended to retire from the post within two years. Nutbeam is one of the biggest earners in the sector. Last year his salary went up by more than £19,000 to an overall package of £333,000. Other university heads say Southampton has fallen short of its student recruitment targets for the past two years, but a Southampton spokesman said there was no link between the VC’s departure and a shortfall in student numbers: “In a statement to staff and students at the time, the chair of council, Gill Rider, said that Professor Nutbeam’s decision to retire relates directly to his desire to pursue his academic interests in public health.”</p> <p>Prof Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University, who proudly states that 20% of his salary is performance related, maintains that hard-hitting commercial questions from governors do universities good: “Let’s be honest, although we aren’t just a business, we are a business, and I need help with some of the big commercial issues. The scrutiny of people with a business background is incredibly helpful,” he says.</p> <p>He adds: “Some boards are over-zealous and micromanage. And equally some management teams try to bounce their board by not telling them things. But in my view any failure of a university is a failure of governance.”</p> <p>Chris Sayers, chair of Northumbria University and a former regional director at BT, believes that in this uncertain climate, boards have a more important role than ever. “Money is now following the student and student-number controls are being relaxed. It means if you don’t get the number of students you need, you don’t get your top line revenue, and that is a massive change. This is competition as never before. People who think we can ignore the business side of this are very much mistaken.” </p> <p>Sayers admits that he has had some “challenging conversations” with the vice-chancellor and his team at Northumbria. “But our relationship is based on trust,” he says. “Without it any institution is in big trouble.”</p> <p>He adds: “The relationship between the university board and the executive is a partnership. And any partnership is like a teabag. You don’t know how strong it is until you put it in hot water.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 26 November 2014.

Education doesn’t have the sort of shared evidence base that is available to medical staff – and politics fills the gap.</p> <p>However, things could be about to change. There is an increasingly powerful voice in education that is calling for a shift in culture from one where ideas seem to re-emerge with a different label every few years to one where we build on evidence of what has gone before.</p> <p>Seeds are being sown; the <a href=\"http://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk\" title=\"\">Education Endowment Foundation</a> is spending millions of public money to invest in high-quality research; funding bodies such as the Wellcome Trust and Esmée Fairbairn, universities such as York and Durham, thinktanks such as Nesta are all looking at what might happen if evidence is placed centre stage.</p> <p>Most encouraging of all, teachers are beginning to drive the change. The rapid growth in organisations such as ResearchEd – a grassroots initiative that brings together teachers who want to improve the links with research – shows a thirst to find out what works in the classroom and share it with others.</p> <p>Laws’s idea tries to catch the edge of this revolution but I’m not convinced that he has the right focus or solution. He highlights the curriculum as being the area that should be free from political interference and while I couldn’t defend the constant meddling of recent years, it is a far more complicated than that. The knowledge and skills that children are taught are certainly not a matter just for politicians but neither are they a matter just for teachers, subject experts or universities. We all have a stake.</p> <p>Laws’s solution is to entrust the responsibility to an independent body. Part of the turmoil of recent years has been the constant shift of powers and responsibilities, from government to local authorities to schools to quangos and back again. I can see why an independent body is seen as the answer but the prospect hardly fills me with excitement. Education already has its share of such organisations – Ofqual, Ofsted and the funding agencies, for example, and I’m not convinced that they are seen as significantly different from government.</p> <p>I would focus the debate around where to place the boundary between education and politics on the issue of who decides how teachers should teach – after all, that is what makes the difference.</p> <p>Parties currently have policies on how reading should be taught, whether pupils should be set by ability and even whether teachers should adopt whole-class teaching. Soon, a school’s rating could depend on whether it complies.</p> <p>This is the debate from which politics should be excluded and where the line should be drawn. Pedagogy is becoming a case of opinion and prejudice rather than a decision based on evidence and professional judgment.</p> <p>Although it would be tempting to follow the usual path of giving responsibility for gathering and disseminating evidence to an independent body, we need to be more imaginative. Freedom from unnecessary interference is important, but the users – in this case teachers – need to be able to shape it to meet their needs. The gain might not only be a change in the relationship between politics and education, but for the first time teachers would have access to good quality evidence to inform their decisions. It might have the potential to be a big idea for both politics and education.</p> <p>Estelle Morris is chair of the executive board at the Institute of Effective Education, University of York</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9785715","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2196741","internalContentCode":"452356962","internalRevision":"11","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Instead of political meddling, why don’t we look to rigorous research to decide what works in our classrooms? asks Estelle Morris","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Teaching needs less ideology, and more evidence","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Estelle Morris","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-11-25T07:10:06.863Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416571859915/education-research-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"546f2847e4b0770f491f744e","newspaperPageNumber":"39","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-28T07:10:07Z","standfirst":"I failed to persuade my own party, but I still believe politicians should not tell teachers how to teach","linkText":"Teaching needs less ideology, and more evidence | Estelle Morris","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-25T07:10:07.000Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/25/teaching-needs-less-ideology-more-evidence","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/nov/25/teaching-needs-less-ideology-more-evidence","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"669122a631ce5278f0973914ce8a608c87351766","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416571865333/education-research-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","picdarUrn":"GD*3863547","suppliersReference":"200522794-001","altText":"education research","caption":"'The knowledge and skills that children are taught are not a matter just for politicians … we all have a stake in it.'

After five years, if all goes to plan, she will end up with a permanent job. What makes her promotion unusual is that Latham was appointed to the role on a part-time basis only a few weeks after returning to work from maternity leave. “I haven’t seen this kind of prestigious role offered part-time anywhere else,” she says. “Normally if you are looking for a part-time position, you are looking at term-time teaching roles.”</p> <p>Latham is one of the lucky ones. Female academics find it disproportionately difficult to juggle their career and parenthood. Fewer professors, lecturers and researchers at some leading universities are taking maternity leave than in 2010, while at others there has been little or no improvement.</p> <p>If more women were being promoted into staff and senior jobs, the numbers taking maternity leave would rise. Instead they are stagnating, or, worryingly, in some cases, falling. That’s the finding of new research by Education Guardian and comes as figures published on Tuesday reveal a persistent pay gap, the continued dominance of men in senior roles, and very few permanent part-time academic jobs.</p> <p>We surveyed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2014/jun/02/university-league-tables-2015-the-complete-list\">top 10 institutions</a> in the 2015 Guardian university league table for the numbers of professors, associate professors and lecturers taking maternity leave. In 2010, the average number of academics who took maternity leave at these universities was 14. By 2013 it had dipped slightly to 12. At Cambridge and St Andrews, though, the numbers have fallen more dramatically. While in 2010, 13 Cambridge professors and lecturers went on maternity leave, by 2013 this number had dropped to six. At St Andrews, the number fell from 14 to six in the same period. Is it a statistical blip, or a worrying trend?</p> <p>Women in academia take less time off to have a baby than those in other careers, the research found. The average length of maternity leave at Cambridge and St Andrews, for example, was 187 days and 138 days respectively in 2013. That’s well below the norm: figures from the Department for Work and Pensions suggests the typical length of maternity leave is 273 days. At both universities the length of leave has fallen since 2010. Out of the top 10 institutions in the Guardian league table, six were able to provide data on the length of maternity leave taken by academics. The average was 191 days.</p> <p>“It’s much more difficult for academics to take maternity leave than support staff or administrators in higher education,” says Ellen Pugh, senior policy adviser at the <a href=\"http://www.ecu.ac.uk\">Equality Challenge Unit</a>, a charity seeking to improve diversity in higher education.</p> <p>The ECU’s annual data report, published on Tuesday, shows how pervasive the dominance of men in academia still is. More than three times as many men as women hold professorships; there are more than twice as many male department heads and there are still only 35 female vice-chancellors (out of 170), the report found.</p> <p>And then there’s the pay. Whereas the majority of women earned less than £42,000, most men earned more than that. Nearly three-quarters of roles paying more than £57,000 were held by men. Overall, there is a 13.6% median pay gap between male and female academics and it is not closing.</p> <p>Close to two-thirds of full-time academics are men, whereas more than half of part-time academics are women. But many of these part-time roles are either hourly teaching or fixed-term research contracts and maternity pay for these academics is usually a lot less generous, according to figures this year from the Universities and Colleges Union. Only 6.9% of academic senior management roles are part time, the ECU report shows.</p> <p>“A lot of women end up taking poorly paid contracts once they have children, rather than permanent jobs,” says Deborah Sugg Ryan, associate professor of history and theory of design at Falmouth University.</p> <p>These contracts themselves can make taking maternity leave difficult. Fay Davies, now a research fellow in the school of the built environment at Salford University but previously a meteorologist, says it is a particular problem in the sciences. “The contracts are getting shorter and shorter. If you have got a three-year contract you can probably fit in a maternity leave, but if it is only for one year, it makes maternity leave very problematic.”</p> <p>In meteorology, she says: “So many women opt not to have children. Pregnancy is almost seen as unprofessional.”</p> <p>Job shares are even rarer. When Harriet Atkinson’s third child was born in 2012, she was eligible only for statutory maternity pay. On her return to work, Atkinson, now on a part-time lecturer contract at Brighton University, wanted to find a permanent position. “Because a lot of permanent jobs are full time, I tried to apply for a job share. My job share partner and I got to the final interview stage, only to be asked how we would work it if we had to go on a research trip for 10 days at a time. So of course we didn’t get the job as neither of us could juggle that with small children.”</p> <p>But some universities are bucking the trend. Partners Julia Böttcher and Peter Allen are both assistant professors of mathematics at the London School of Economics. The couple, who have two children, are highly unusual in that they applied to work at the university in 2011 as a job share (although they are now treated as separate part-time workers). In addition, they have benefited from the LSE’s generous parental leave system. When their second child was born in May, Böttcher took 18 weeks’ maternity leave at full pay, while Allen is now a few weeks into his 16 weeks’ paternity leave (also at full pay). UCU figures show many universities still pay only the statutory minimum: the first six weeks at 90% pay, then 33 weeks at statutory maternity pay – currently £138.18 a week.</p> <p>“Everyone was very positive and no one complained I was taking so much time off,” says Allen. Böttcher was offered the option to have a reduced teaching load for one semester. Both are also able to do some work from home.</p> <p>Oxford University, meanwhile, has seen the number of professors and associate professors taking maternity leave increase 18% from 2010 levels to 26 in 2013. A spokesman says this is partly because of the generous maternity pay, but also the support given to returning mothers. The university is one of those that offer a phased return following maternity leave, where women may gradually increase their hours. Oxford, like Cambridge, also has a returning carers’ scheme, which allows academic and research staff to apply for cash awards to support their return to work.</p> <p>Changes to how research is assessed should make it easier for female academics to maintain their research ratings, another factor that has hindered longer periods of maternity leave. The Research Assessment Exercise, the last of which took place in 2008, did not take account of any career breaks, but the new Research Excellence Framework, due to report next month, has reduced the research expectations for parents who have taken maternity leave or additional paternity leave beyond two weeks.</p> <p>Some universities compete for the ECU’s <a href=\"http://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charter-marks/athena-swan/\">Athena Swan</a> and gender equality <a href=\"http://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charter-marks/gender-equality-charter-mark/\">Charter Mark </a>schemes, which promote women’s representation in science and humanities departments respectively. Both schemes take account of how pregnancy, maternity leave and women’s return to work are managed. “We put a lot of effort, not just centrally, but at school level, to make it easy for women to take maternity leave,” says Yvonne Galligan, of Queen’s University Belfast, one of only five silver-level Athena Swan institutions. “The university expects that women going on maternity will be able to take it without worrying that their work will pile up and force them to come back early.”</p> <p>Responding to Cambridge’s maternity leave figures, a spokesman says: “We recognise that there are challenges for many staff when returning from maternity leave and have introduced various policies and initiatives to support the careers of academics.” Cambridge is also an institutional Athena Swan silver award winner.</p> <p>A spokesman for the University of St Andrews says: “These figures are very small and cannot be taken as evidence of a trend; as fluctuations are inevitable in such a small sample. However we are not complacent, and have introduced a single equality outcomes scheme, put in place an equal pay statement, introduced flexible working, and created a female academic networking scheme.”</p> <p>Back at Liverpool, Latham’s boss, Tom Solomon, director of the Institute of Infection and Global Health, says encouraging part-time and flexible working is a no-brainer. “It makes sense. Otherwise you are handicapping half of your workforce,” he says. “You have to create an environment and structures where women can really excel.

Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>There’s a debacle going on in our schools that no one is talking about – especially not the government. That is wrong, because it will potentially mess up the lives of children turning 16 this academic year. So let’s talk about it.</p> <p>For the past 14 years, if you sat A-levels, your final grade was based on a number of exams taken at different points across your two years of study. If you did badly at one, you could resit. Beyond giving more opportunities for improving grades, this process had two other advantages. First, universities could see the grades so far achieved by a student when they applied for a place. And second, students could drop subjects at the halfway point while still receiving a formal (AS) qualification.</p> <p>From next September, however, the government has decreed that A-levels will return to being a two-year qualification. Exams will all be taken, just once, at the end of the two years’ study. The mid-point AS exams will be stripped out and offered as a standalone qualification.</p> <p>At first, this doesn’t sound too much of a debacle. Won’t sixth forms just offer the standalone AS levels first and then have students sit the full A-level in their second year? Well, no. Because, in its wisdom, the government asked exam boards to make sure the materials don’t easily overlap. Ministers want students to either do the AS or the A-level, but not both.</p> <p>So which do you take? No one knows. Cue debacle. Government sentiment is that the new A-levels are more “rigorous” and universities prefer them. Though given that almost all degree courses are modular, I expect “universities” is more likely to be ministerial shorthand for “my mates who are professors at a couple of Oxbridge colleges”.</p> <p>There were suggestions when the changes were announced that they would reduce the amount of teaching time that was being lost to exams and that they would relieve stress on students. This sudden concern for students’ stress levels seems disingenuous from a party intent on assessing four-year-olds and which had to be talked down from ranking children in their primary school exams. ​​</p> <p>B​esides, it’s not true. Without formal AS ​exams at the end of year 12, sixth forms will ​likely still run mock exams to ensure students are well-practised and can check their progress. As for stress, the one-shot nature of A-level exams​ will likely send student blood pressure skywards.</p> <p>Then there are the practical problems facing schools and colleges with the policy’s implementation. Funding to sixth forms has been cut; they will now receive funds only for three subjects per student. Given the lack of overlap between AS and A-level, it’s likely that only the brightest students would cope with sitting both. Solely offering three A-levels, and ditching AS levels ​entirely, seems the best option to many.</p> <p>This,​ though, comes at a price. Faced with “one shot” exams, students pick safer choices. “Try it for AS, and drop it if it’s too hard” is a common coaxing option in subjects such as maths and foreign languages, in which teenagers often have low confidence despite good skill levels.</p> <p>Cambridge University last week added a further twist when it <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29914310\" title=\"\">wrote to schools</a> urging them not just to do A-levels but to enter students for the standalone AS. Its reasoning is sound: without AS grades students will be selected for university places based on less-recent GCSEs, or the notoriously unreliable <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/22/half-a-level-grade-predictions-wrong\" title=\"\">predicted grades</a>.</p> <p>Even if schools and colleges can pick their way through the minefield and find a sensible way to deal with this for their students, it’s still likely that the summer of 2017 will culminate in problems. Students will sit all of their new exams at once; exam boards will have to mark them – all at once – and no one has the foggiest how grades will be affected by the newly introduced “rigour”. If it works as it should, grades ought to go down. What does this mean for university offers? No one knows, but a good guess is that students just returning from a gap year, with A-levels already under their belts, will be at a serious advantage over thousands of others now unexpectedly getting lower grades – who will be plunged into the chaotic clearing system to find a university place.</p> <p>The education secretary said in a speech this year that she didn’t believe the government had acted too fast. She wants to <a href=\"http://press.conservatives.com/post/98807929855/nicky-morgan-speech-to-conservative-party-conference\" title=\"\">plough on</a> with this “reform”.</p> <p>But with something this half-cooked it has to be worth delaying – even if just for a year. Exam boards still haven’t released their syllabuses, universities don’t know what they want, funding is tumultuous. The only reason for barrelling ahead is because there’s an election next year. But that is irrelevant if you’re a teenager making decisions about your entire future.</p> <p>We need to talk about this issue, and the government needs to fix it now. Sixteen-year-olds will only live this year once. Let’s not disrupt their futures for the sake of an election.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9758771","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-18T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2192448","internalContentCode":"451845289","internalRevision":"10","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Schools, students, exam boards and universities aren’t ready but the change to ‘one-shot’ exams is happening anyway, says <strong>Laura McInerney</strong>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"This half-baked A-level reform is being rushed for the election","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Laura McInerney","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-11-18T07:10:03.207Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/13/1415900060825/A-levels-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5464e8f7e4b0cb80d027b802","newspaperPageNumber":"43","internalStoryPackageCode":"82731","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-21T07:10:03Z","standfirst":"Schools, students, exam boards and universities aren’t ready but the change to ‘one-shot’ exams is happening anyway","linkText":"This half-baked A-level reform is being rushed for the election | Laura McInerney","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-20T17:51:50.000Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/18/half-baked-a-level-reform-rushed-election","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/nov/18/half-baked-a-level-reform-rushed-election","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"fd9a27608f874d6053dbac6d3a3e10ee8a84965d","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/13/1415900067119/A-levels-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA","picdarUrn":"GD*45777661","suppliersReference":"EDUCATION_Languages_134060.JPG","altText":"A-levels","caption":"From next September A-levels will return to being a two-year qualification with exams taken at the end of the period.

Governors must henceforth, we were told, ensure that schools “actively promote the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs …”</p> <p>The Friends School Council, which supports Quakers in education, had argued in the consultation that “British values” should be replaced by “human rights” or “international law”, but this view was seemingly not taken on board.</p> <p>At a time when the UK government is sending bombers to the Middle East, we had a weekend to think what the “fundamental British values of democracy” might actually be. Are British values different from French or Swedish ones? How can governors really ascertain the level of our activity in promoting these values, whatever they might be? Can we look at values without seeing how these are translated into action? And should we really promote an unquestioning adherence to the rule of law?</p> <p>As a Quaker, I tend to believe that we should at the very least question the rule of law, and indeed, on occasion, feel compelled to break it. The Quakers’ guide publication Advices And Queries says: “Respect the laws of the state but let your first loyalty be to God’s purposes. If you feel impelled by strong conviction to break the law, search your conscience deeply.”</p> <p>It has been the questioning and challenging of the rule of law that has shaped and developed some of the British values that we are now asked to promote. Acceptance of the law would have meant that slavery remained legal, that homosexuality was a criminal offence and that women were wrong to campaign for universal suffrage.</p> <p>It is not difficult to find modern examples of activity endorsed by the government that would seem to breach the demand that we “encourage respect for democracy” and “further tolerance and harmony between different cultural traditions”. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/uk-firm-sold-teargas-hong-kong-review-sales-policy\" title=\"\">The sale of the teargas used against demonstrators in Hong Kong by UK arms company Chemring is unlikely to be condemned by the government</a>.</p> <p>Indeed, as Sarah Waldron from the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) said: “Last year’s arms fair in London welcomed some of the most authoritarian regimes in the world and those who profit from their brutality. The deals done here fuel death, injury, fear and repression – yet instead of banning it, the government helps make it happen.”</p> <p>Those who felt impelled to draw attention to this anomaly were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass.</p> <p>At least the new regulation requires governors to encourage respect for other people, “paying particular regard to the protected characteristics set out in the Equality Act 2010”.</p> <p>How does “freedom of speech” – which is surely a British value that all of us could agree is central to our democracy – and the requirement that, in political issues, students “are offered a balanced presentation of opposing views”, sit with this insistence that we not only must enable “pupils to acquire a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in England” but we also must enable them to have respect for those same institutions and services (though not, by the way, for the Welsh or Scottish ones, which are presumably not deemed worthy of respect in our British-value driven culture).</p> <p>Of course we want students’ experiences not to be blighted by bigotry but this authoritarianism – motivated by a fear that multiculturalism has failed in some of our communities – is not a clear or practical way forward.</p> <p>I object from a liberal Quaker perspective to the idea that the individual conscience isn’t valued: am I guilty of brainwashing in expressing this principle to my students? I think that one of Quaker schools’ strengths is that we do not believe we have a monopoly over the truth and actively encourage our students to question authority. This falls far short of the proselytising that the establishment seems to accept from many faith schools, who can demand, for example, church attendance as a condition of admission.</p> <p>I worry that this new legislation sounds like authoritarianism and could be the basis for heresy hunts.</p> <p>At our school we will hold on to some values that are wider than “British” and might look for our inspiration to human rights legislation and international law. Above all, we hope that we can translate some of these values into student action, including the right to protest.</p> <p>Michael Goodwin is headteacher of Sibford school, one of seven independent Quaker schools in the UK and Ireland</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9731635","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-11T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2188530","internalContentCode":"451437481","internalRevision":"23","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Blind acceptance of the law would mean that slavery was still legal and homosexuality was still a crime, says Quaker school headmaster <strong>Michael Goodwin</strong>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"British values?
