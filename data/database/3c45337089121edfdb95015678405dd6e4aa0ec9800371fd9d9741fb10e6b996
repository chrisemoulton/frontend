famed for controversial films on subjects ranging from local neo-Nazis to gay themes has been cancelled in favour of a replacement backed by Vladimir Putin’s administration.</p> <p>Moscow city council abruptly removed funding for Moscow Premiere’s 13th edition, which was due to commence on 2 September, citing the local economic downturn, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/moscow-premiere-film-festival-canceled-817830\">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>. </p> <p>“Due to the difficult economic conditions, the culture department of Moscow has to limit the use of budgetary resources in 2015 and cancel funding of several events, including Moscow Premiere,” wrote the Moscow government culture committee in a letter to organisers. It also revealed that a new, “positive, youth-oriented” festival would be set up to replace Premiere, chaired by council member Yevgeny Gerasimov, a member of Putin’s ruling United Russia party. It is understood the Youth Festival of Life Affirming Film will run from 4 until 7 September.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/10/russias-film-festivals-exempted-from-national-unity-licensing-rules\">Russia's film festivals exempted from 'national unity' licensing rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Film critic Vyacheslav Shmyrov, who headed Moscow Premiere, said he would refuse to work with the new festival , and did not hold out much hope that screenings from the 13th edition could be rescued.</p> <p>“Our festival was running 12 years and had a very different program, showing films such as Russia-88 and Winter’s Path,” he told newspaper Noviye Izvestia. Russia-88 is Pavel Bardin’s 2009 mockumentary about Russian neo-Nazis, while 2013’s Winter’s Path centres on a classical singer who begins a same-sex relationship with a street thug.</p> <p>Tickets for Moscow Premiere had been available for free via vouchers found in local newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets. “It is primarily a social festival and a charity project that exists for those people, especially the older generation, who cannot afford to go to the movies,” said Shmyrov. “It is mainly a social mission.”</p> <p>In February, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/10/russias-film-festivals-exempted-from-national-unity-licensing-rules\">it was reported that Russia would make festivals </a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/10/russias-film-festivals-exempted-from-national-unity-licensing-rules\">exempt </a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/10/russias-film-festivals-exempted-from-national-unity-licensing-rules\">from controversial new regulations</a> requiring all films to secure an exhibition licence before they might be screened in public. New rules aimed at cracking down on features that “threaten national unity” or “defile culture” were introduced last year.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"City council removes funding for Moscow Premiere, which screened films with controversial themes, replacing it with new Youth Festival of Life Affirming Film","headline":"Radical Moscow film festival cancelled in favour of Putin-backed replacement","byline":"Ben Child","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/27/1440661808249/9a60ad85-932a-4714-b2cc-c0a56a4eca60-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-09-03T00:00:00+01:00","standfirst":"<p>City council removes funding for Moscow Premiere, which screened films with controversial themes, replacing it with new Youth Festival of Life Affirming Film</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/27/radical-moscow-film-festival-cancelled-in-favour-of-putin-backed-replacement","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/aug/27/radical-moscow-film-festival-cancelled-in-favour-of-putin-backed-replacement","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/festivals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/festivals","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/russia","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","webTitle":"Ben Child","r2ContributorId":"24984","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/19/1426761348767/Ben-Child.jpg","firstName":"ben","lastName":"child","twitterHandle":"BenChildGeek","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Child is a Guardian film writer and the blogger behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/week-in-geek\">The Week in Geek</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[]}]},{"id":"world/2015/aug/27/russian-sanctions-quiz-forbidden-food-and-contraband-clothes","elements":[{"id":"ffca8aa047cdc68a30609da5bc45681b2c31f3cb","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440603519804/300e7fc9-59c1-4902-9a95-c8a48d912f99-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"Barcroft Media","displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440603519804/300e7fc9-59c1-4902-9a95-c8a48d912f99-220x132.jpeg","source":"TASS / Barcroft Media","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Putin","suppliersReference":"TS00B5A5","height":"132","credit":"Photograph: TASS / Barcroft Media","caption":"What has Putin assigned to the banned list since the annexation of Crimea?

At least he got the choice of venue right, given audiences will want a stiff drink – probably several – if they manage to sit through all of the veteran actor’s behind–the–camera debut. </p> <p>This rancid battle–of–the–sexes chamber piece, co-directed and co-produced by Jarratt and Kaarin Fairfax (who both star in the lead roles), is billed as a “comedy thriller”. </p> <p>It’s more like a marathon of smut, with nothing remotely funny or thrilling about it. Indeed something very funny must have been in the water for the participants to have put so much energy into such a crass exercise: a 90–minute slagging match between an ageing misogynist tied to a kitchen chair and his 50-something female tormentor, who returns blows in between making tea, baking cupcakes and doing the ironing. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A3GPHLu4MQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5A3GPHLu4MQ?start=88&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=88\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The trailer for StalkHer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is a hunter–becomes–hunted role reversal for Jarratt, best known for his performances in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/18/wolf-creek-classic-australian-films\">Wolf Creek movies</a> which had him picking off foreign tourists in meticulous gory detail. In this film, he plays a mop-haired balaclava-clad stalker named Jack who sneaks into the house of hospital nurse Emily (Fairfax) at night armed with a bag of torture instruments, only to be tasered and wake up gagged and immobilised.</p> <p>Positioned at opposite ends of the kitchen table, the two then engage in a bizarre tête–à–tête that consumes the film. It’s a sort of foreplay gone bad, filled with endless talk about the opposite sex using some of the filthiest turns of phrase imaginable. The concept is like a middle-aged version of 2009 prom night horror-drama The Loved Ones, given the awkward atmosphere of a low-rent student theatre production intended predominantly to shock and offend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/18/wolf-creek-classic-australian-films\">Wolf Creek: Rewatching classic Australian films</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mission accomplished, but StalkHer is mostly just offensive as a work of art. Perhaps the film’s greatest achievement is that it somehow manages to extensively degrade both genders. Jack’s dialogue is unrelentingly misogynistic, his character never transcending the shallowest or most aggravating of stereotypes. Screenwriter Kristijana Maric ignores – or just doesn’t care – that Jack’s supposed challenge is to convince Emily to let him go unscathed.</p> <p>On one occasion, Emily remarks that she is waiting for the right person to “pop her cork” and on another, wonders aloud whether she would be better off with “a boy like you” (for the record, Jarratt is 64). The characters speak to each other as if they were written to be potty-mouthed adolescents; for the first time in the history of Australian cinema two lead actors have been miscast by approximately 40 years. </p> <p>Their exhausting exchange is broken up with visions of the characters fantasizing about various ways to hurt each other. Jack growls “I own you” as he grabs Emily around the neck and pushes her against the wall. Emily imagines kissing him while literally stabbing him in the heart. The centerpiece gag involves Jack urinating into a vase while Emily holds his penis with a mitten. Are you laughing yet? </p> <p>At first StalkHer struggles with plausibility (why did she take two bites out of an apple, then throw it out the window? Why is he carrying torture instruments?) and soon becomes intolerable. Jarratt flails about in flabbergasted sexist mode, delivering nonstop bile in lieu of a character arc, while Fairfax tries her best to imbue Emily with the flavour of a snaky vixen. </p> <p>But the script, relentlessly mean-spirited and topped off with preposterous twists, does them no favours.

Later that day Guardian Australia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/26/sydney-school-received-no-complaints-from-parents-about-gayby-baby-film\">established that no parents of students at Burwood girls high had complained to the school</a>.</p> <p>“During school hours we expect them to be doing maths and English and curriculum matters,” Piccoli told 2GB Radio. “This movie is not part of the curriculum and that’s why I’ve made that direction.”</p> <p>His orders followed a front-page story in Sydney’s Daily Telegraph which alleged there had been a “backlash from parents” over the planned screening.</p> <p>A comment piece accompanying the story claimed there had been “numerous complaints” and argued that Piccoli should be sacked if he allowed the screening to go ahead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>As Burwood girls, we pride ourselves on our support of diversity – in whatever form it takes</p> <footer> <cite>School prefects</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the Department of Education confirmed later on Wednesday not a single complaint had been made by parents to the school.</p> <p>Asked if Piccoli had been aware no parents had complained when he pulled the film, a spokeswoman for the minister said his decision “was not driven by complaints of any nature, but rather a need to adhere to policy and procedure, and for class time to be used to teach the curriculum”.</p> <p>“The minister was made aware by the department, that departmental policies and procedures had not been adhered to in the school’s decision to screen the film,” she said. </p> <p>“He directed the department of education that the film Gayby Baby must not be shown in school time so that it does not impact on the delivery of the planned lessons.”</p> <p>The NSW premier, Mike Baird, said he supported the ban on the film. “I understand the intent of that is to provide an example of tolerance and that’s something I absolutely support,” he said. “Should it be in class time? No, I don’t think so. Should it be optional? Yes, I do think so.”</p> <p>Prefects from Burwood girls high condemned the media coverage that contributed to the screening being stopped in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1615283298721278&amp;id=1538173326432276\">a statement posted to Facebook</a>. “As Burwood girls, we pride ourselves on our support of diversity – in whatever form it takes,” they said.</p> <p>“When it is considered that the LGBTIQ community has the highest rates of suicide of any population in Australia and experience significantly higher rates of mental health issues, we consider our support to be just one small step in creating better understanding in the community.”</p> <p>The students said events were regularly held “which aim to support and celebrate the diversity of our school community”, including lunar new year celebrations and dinners to break the Ramadan fast.</p> <p>“We consider ourselves leaders in the push for equality and acceptance – for all people,” they wrote.</p> <p>The film’s director, Maya Newell, is an alumnus of Burwood girls high. “The film is not an advocacy film at all,” she said. “It is really just projecting the voice of children who are existing in our society.”</p> <p>An activist group, Community Action Against Homophobia,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1501534056807095/\"> plans to protest outside the Daily Telegraph’s office on Sunday</a> over its coverage.</p> <p>The film was to be screened as part of Wear it Purple Day, a campaign aimed at supporting LBTGIQ students.</p> <p>Parents of students at the school told Guardian Australia they had been “delighted” at plans to show Gayby Baby. One parent, Genevieve, said parents were clearly advised they “had every opportunity to stop our children seeing it”.</p> <p>“It’s PG-rated, and from what I understand it’s about families and parents and there’s nothing overtly sexual about it, or offensive.”</p> <p>Nor was she concerned about the film being screened during class. “That’s exactly where they should be learning stuff like this,” she said.</p> <p>The NSW opposition leader, Luke Foley, said by banning the film Baird “has sent a dreadful, heartless message to the many LBGTI families who enrich our tolerant, diverse state”.<br />“At the end of the day, our children need to live their lives in loving families free of discrimination - and every family deserves our respect,” he said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/27/news-limited-should-watch-gayby-baby-they-might-learn-something-about-respect\">Writing for Guardian Australia</a>, the federal Labor senator Penny Wong said the need to show support for young same sex-attracted and gender diverse young people “couldn’t be greater”.</p> <p>She said a survey of young LGBTI Australians had shown that 64% had been verbally abused, 18% physically abused and 16% had attempted suicide.</p> <p>“Behind these statistics are stories of deep personal hurt. The young people and the teachers who work to reduce harm in our schools deserve support, not condemnation,” she wrote.</p> <p><strong>Statement from Burwood girls high school prefects:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Prefects of BGHS wish to express their disappointment at the media coverage of the school’s intended showing of the documentary Gayby Baby.</p> <p>As Burwood girls, we pride ourselves on our support of diversity - in whatever form it takes.</p> <p>Throughout the year we partake in multiple events which aim to support and celebrate the diversity of our school community as a collective.</p> <p>These include International Day- which celebrates our multicultural community- this year raising $15,000 for international charities, an annual Iftar dinner to support out Islamic community, and Lunar New Year celebrations to support our Asian community, amongst a range of others.</p> <p>We consider ourselves leaders in the push for equality and acceptance -

A News Limited columnist told a 12-year-old girl she wasn’t part of a normal family and attacked an organisation dedicated to reducing bullying in schools as a “political front”.</p> <p>Talking about others’ sexuality or attacking 12 year olds are priorities for some, but it’s hard to comprehend how either could be more important than preventing bullying and keeping our children safe.</p> <p>Wear it Purple is a youth suicide prevention initiative. It was created in response to the death of Tyler Clementi in 2010. Tragically, Tyler took his own life following his outing by a roommate.</p> <p>On Wear it Purple day young people wear coloured clothing to show support for their LGBTI schoolmates, promote tolerance and understanding, and raise awareness of the tragic consequences of bullying.</p> <p>The need for the Wear it Purple initiative couldn’t be greater. Many schools remain confronting places for young people – especially students who are “different”. A recent Australian survey of LGBTI young people showed that 64% of young people had been verbally abused, 18% had been physically abused and 16% had attempted suicide. Behind these statistics are stories of deep personal hurt. The young people and the teachers who work to reduce harm in our schools deserve support, not condemnation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/08/gayby-baby-review-compelling-look-at-the-daily-lives-of-kids-of-same-sex-couples\">Gayby Baby review – compelling look at children of same-sex couples</a> </p> </aside>  <p>State schools have been among the strongest supporters of anti-bullying and anti-homophobia initiatives. That’s why it is disappointing the NSW education minister has directed schools not to screen Gayby Baby during school hours.</p> <p>Gayby Baby is a documentary about children growing up with gay and lesbian parents. The children in the film have heard plenty of other people express an opinion about what it means it grow up with two mums or two dads. The film gives them a voice. As filmmaker Maya Newell says, “Everyone seems to have an opinion about what’s best, but no one was asking those kids.”</p> <p>Almost none of the people complaining about Gayby Baby have seen it – including, I suspect, the education minister who banned its screening during school hours.</p> <p>I’d encourage them to turn down the outrage and watch the film.</p> <p>They might learn something from these kids about respect, love and tolerance.</p>","productionOffice":"AUS","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"The need for the ‘Wear it Purple’ initiative has never been greater.

Jimmy Chin, two of the world’s strongest climbers, partnered up with relative newcomer Renan Ozturk to tackle the Shark’s Fin on Meru, a 21,000-foot knife edge balanced on a mix of technical rock slabs, snow and rotten ice in northern India. </p> <p>It had never been summited before, and their attempt went about as badly as it could: they ran out of food, suffered frostbite, and were forced to turn back just 100 meters from the summit. Despite the damage, Anker, now 52, spent the following three years “possessed” by the Shark’s Fin. Not even a traumatic brain injury Ozturk sustained backcountry skiing or an avalanche that almost killed Chin on the same project could stop them.</p> <p>This is the inauspicious starting point for the newly released climbing film Meru, a Sundance standout that promises to be one of those rare adventure films that can attract a mainstream audience – in large part because its white-knuckle footage has a storyline to match. Directed by Chin, the film chronicles a decades’ long obsession with a peak known in Buddhist legend as the “center of the universe”, which lures Anker, Chin and Ozturk even as summiting it threatens their lives.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/aug/26/meru-trailer-jimmy-chin-renan-ozturk-conrad-anker-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4bng5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2359481\"            data-video-name=\"Meru trailer: 'I didn't know what we were getting into' – video\"            data-video-provider=\"courtesy of Music Box Films\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-55db8b49e4b066a0c2408e84\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/08/24/150724MERUTRAILER_FromGuAmRM-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10712412&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/08/24/150724MERUTRAILER_FromGuAmRM/150724MERUTRAILER_FromGuAmRM.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10712412&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/08/24/150724MERUTRAILER_FromGuAmRM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption>The Meru trailer.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Returning to the mountain in 2011, says Chin, felt “like we were heading to the gallows”. As they ascend in dizzying panoramic shots, Ozturk is filmed struggling with each step. Still recovering from a severed vertebral artery sustained in his skiing accident five months prior, which cut off half the blood to his brain, Ozturk begins suffering an apparent stroke and collapses into the tent. The logical response would have been to descend. But the trio pushes forward because they need something to “hold on to”. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>All three have lost friends to the mountains. Anker’s mentor, Terrance “Mugs” Stump, died on Denali (Mt McKinley, in Alaska) in 1992, leaving Anker with the unfinished business of summiting Shark’s Fin, Mugs’s longtime dream.</p> <p>Far from slowing them down, the damage they endure seems to drive them forward – all three broken men, fighting the sky. </p> <p>“Meru is the anti-Everest,” says mountaineer and author Jon Krakauer. “This climb has seen more attempts and more failures than any peak in the Himalaya.”</p> <p>You might say the same about the film itself, which has been years and many false summits in the making.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a573c380b7cb392fd28b92115e5f717005682904\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a573c380b7cb392fd28b92115e5f717005682904/0_144_5616_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conrad Anker on Meru in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conrad Anker on Meru in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jimmy Chin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I interviewed Ozturk about the imminent release of House of Cards, as it was then called, back in 2012, he was living in Boulder, Colorado, and editing what he thought would be a 50-minute adventure film to premiere at Telluride Mountainfilm that summer. Three years and numerous festival rejections later, the film won the 2015 Audience Award for best documentary at Sundance and is in the process of a nationwide general release – uncommon treatment for a genre of film typically satisfied by 20 minutes of action sequences.</p> <p>Ozturk wrote in a 2012 email: “Although standing on the summit with Jimmy and Conrad was surreal and emotional, it’s becoming more and more clear to me that sharing this film is going to end up being our ultimate resolution to all the PTSD of the experience, hopefully a work of art that does justice to our collective life’s work.”</p> <p>It’s been a long time coming. Documentary film-maker and Meru co-director Chai Vasarhelyi became attached to the project in 2012, after Chin showed her a version of the initial cut. Chin says the project drew them together: the two married the following spring and now have a daughter, Marina.</p> <p>With Vasarhelyi’s help, the film expanded to 90 minutes, with additional interviews from Krakauer and family members that explore the climbers’ compulsive desire to reach the summit.</p> <p>All climbing films deal with testing the limits of human endurance. It’s much less common to find one that successfully explores the psychological toll the mountain takes, and the type of personality able to overcome all the physical signs that it’s time to turn back. </p> <p>“We would hit these blank sections of rock, where I was sure there was nowhere else to go, but then Jimmy or Conrad would launch into the void,” says Ozturk.</p> <p> </p> <p>Most of high-level mountain climbing isn’t glorious. Much of it is failure and – even at the best of times – a kind of abject misery you might enjoy tomorrow because it makes for a great story. </p> <p>Climbing films have often hinted at that insane drive which carries ambitious people to the brink of self-destruction. What separates Meru is its exploration of the dark side of that ambition, and the demons that go with it.</p> <h2>High five</h2> <p>Here are five other climbing films that will make your palms sweat:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9lRXpn8br0\"><strong>Touching the Void</strong></a> (2003) – Kevin MacDonald</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t65VrYZ2U9s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t65VrYZ2U9s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Mountaineers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates recount their notoriously disastrous 1985 climb in the Peruvian Andes, during which Yates was forced to cut the rope on Simpson.

In its second weekend the NWA biopic surged past the $100m mark – blockbuster status – and it only cost $29m to make. It will certainly top 2002’s 8 Mile, starring Eminem, which made about $117m. The last high-profile rap movie to hit multiplexes, 2009’s Notorious, did well too, nearly doubling its $20m budget. You don’t need an MBA to suspect that Hollywood is now taking notice and ready to make more money out of hip-hop biopics. </p> <p> There have already been reports of a Straight Outta Compton sequel, which would take up roughly where the original left off, focusing on Tha Dogg Pound, Snoop Dogg and Tupac. This would make a certain sense, considering that Straight Outta Compton ends abruptly, with Snoop and Tupac appearing only briefly, and Tha Dogg Pound (AKA Daz and Kurupt) barely getting any screen time at all. I seriously doubt it will have the title that Daz mentioned to <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2015/08/21/straight-outta-compton-sequel-snoop-dogg-west-coast-rap/\">TMZ</a> – Dogg Pound 4 Life – however. For the film to have serious Hollywood backing it would probably need to focus on Snoop or Tupac, who are household names. (A representative for the studio behind the original, Universal, <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/21/straight-outta-compton-tupac-snoop-dogg-sequel\">says it has no plans</a> for a Straight Outta Compton sequel.)</p> <p> Speaking of Tupac, Straight Outta Compton’s success seems likely to finally bring about a biopic about him. The most recent version was slated to be directed by Boyz N the Hood director John Singleton, who also directed ’Pac in Poetic Justice. But actor Marcc Rose, who played him in Straight Outta Compton and who bears an <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/5flK1WLIZu/\">uncanny resemblance</a> to the late rapper, <a href=\"http://www.musictimes.com/articles/46011/20150822/straight-outta-compton-actor-marcc-rose-working-tupac-biopic-john-singleton.htm\">says</a> that he and Singleton are currently in talks about bringing the project to life. </p> <p> A true Straight Outta Compton sequel – at least in the spiritual sense – would probably require the involvement of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/straight-outta-compton-film-ice-cube\">Ice Cube.</a> Unlike his co-producer Dr Dre, who was initially skeptical about the NWA film, Cube long pushed for it. But since their musical pathways diverged when Cube went solo in 1989, he wasn’t especially involved in the careers of Snoop, Tupac or Tha Dogg Pound. Hence, he probably wouldn’t be much invested in a film about them. Closer to his heart would be a film about Public Enemy, who have long been closely aligned with Cube (their producers the Bomb Squad co-produced his first album Amerikkka’s Most Wanted).</p> <p> When asked about such a film recently, Cube <a href=\"http://boom92houston.com/17755/could-there-be-a-public-enemy-movie-in-the-works/\">said he was game</a>. For his part, Public Enemy’s leader Chuck D didn’t show as much enthusiasm – “I ain’t acting in it, and I ain’t writing the script. Where do I figure into Hollywood?” he told the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style-blog/wp/2015/08/17/qa-chuck-d-of-public-enemy-talks-n-w-a-the-black-lives-matter-movement-and-bill-cosby/\">Washington Post</a> – but he didn’t rule out the idea completely either. </p> <p> It’s easy to see why a Public Enemy movie might work as well as an NWA one. The groups gained popularity in the same era – hip-hop’s golden age, in the late 80s and early 90s – against a politically charged backdrop, each fighting the effects of Reaganism. But more importantly, they’re at the center of an emerging, hugely-popular new genre of music: classic rap. Just as classic rock became a dominant radio format a few decades after the dawn of rock ‘n’ roll, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/business/media/classic-hip-hop-is-spreading-on-the-radio-dial.html\">classic rap stations</a> are now spreading across the country. In the same way Paul and John, and Mick and Keith, are being re-discovered by each subsequent generation, Dre and Snoop, and Chuck D and Flava Flav, are now beloved by kids who weren’t yet born when they were in their heyday. Not to mention that the now-middle aged folks who grew up with this music are a potent demographic, as well. Straight Outta Compton showed just how much strong this fan base is.</p> <p> Could it even work for the Ice Cream Man? Why not? No Limit Records founder Master P never reached the mainstream in the way NWA did, but his label sold millions upon millions of albums, and a generation of fans now thinks of it as “oldies”. So perhaps, then, one shouldn’t be surprised that the Master P biopic has <a href=\"http://allhiphop.com/2015/08/18/master-p-brings-biopic-open-casting-call-tour-to-a-city-near-you/\">begun holding casting calls</a>.</p> <p> Indeed, artists from previous eras, who are no longer on the charts, tend to make the most compelling subjects for these types of films. I’d love to see a biopic on Lil Wayne, for example, but one suspects that if it were released 20 years from now, it would be a lot juicier content. (In the meantime, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1247371/\">The Carter</a> is one of the best music documentaries I’ve ever seen.) </p> <p> To be honest, Straight Outta Compton’s tribute to Eazy-E made me long for something similar about another deceased great. And so I say: Bring on the <a href=\"http://www.spin.com/2013/01/ol-dirty-bastard-michael-k-williams-omar-the-wire-brooklyn-zoo-biopic/\">Ol’ Dirty Bastard</a> biopic, already! </p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"The success of Straight Outta Compton has seen a renewed interest in formerly floundering biopics about the likes of Tupac, Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Public Enemy","headline":"The Straight Outta Compton effect: prepare to see a lot more rap films","byline":"Ben Westhoff","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c054587503de28d06e34c419626f0df7a15dc801/0_86_3000_1800/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-08-29T11:45:00-04:00","standfirst":"<p>The success of the NWA film has seen a renewed interest in formerly floundering biopics about the likes of Tupac, Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Public Enemy</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/26/straight-outta-compton-hip-hop-movies","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/2015/aug/26/straight-outta-compton-hip-hop-movies","sectionName":"Music","tags":[{"id":"music/hip-hop","webTitle":"Hip-hop","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/hip-hop","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"film/biopics","webTitle":"Biopics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/biopics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/biopics","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"music/urban","webTitle":"Urban music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/urban","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/urban","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"film/straight-outta-compton","webTitle":"Straight Outta Compton","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/straight-outta-compton","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/straight-outta-compton","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"music/rap","webTitle":"Rap","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/rap","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/rap","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"music/snoopdogg","webTitle":"Snoop Dogg","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/snoopdogg","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/snoopdogg","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"music/drdre","webTitle":"Dr Dre","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/drdre","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/drdre","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"music/icecube","webTitle":"Ice Cube","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/icecube","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/icecube","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-westhoff","webTitle":"Ben Westhoff","r2ContributorId":"67185","firstName":"ben","lastName":"westhoff","twitterHandle":"Ben_Westhoff","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Westhoff is the author of Dirty South, the former L.A.

autumn’s films will be full of exceedingly intense actors playing exceedingly intense men in glasses: Tom Hardy as Ronnie Kray in his half-rimmed spectacles; Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs in his rimless ones; Dane DeHaan as James Dean in his tortoiseshells. Men’s glasses are about to have a fashion moment, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/feb/24/book-doctor-wearing-glasses\">and it’s about time</a>. Glasses can make you appear cleverer in a job interview, they can be lowered slightly and peered over quizzically, they can be whipped off in complete exasperation. Also, they’ll improve your vision – no longer will life pass you by<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/oct/31/glasses-latest-must-have-accessory\"> in a vague and abstract blur</a>. Here are five frame styles from the silver screen.</p> <h2><strong>Ronnie Kray</strong></h2> <p>In the (rather tasty) trailer for Legend, Hardy plays both Kray twins, Reggie and Ronnie. You can tell them apart because the latter wears <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/18/niece-of-kray-wife-frances-shea-mortified-by-biopic-starring-tom-hardy\">nice 60s glasses and a permanently displeased expression</a> – like Mark Lamarr on Shooting Stars – and acts like an absolute nutcase. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"890b986ad615e0448efdb2af8b4d9a7feadb58cb\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440585850744/bbaae68a-e2e2-40ef-bed3-fbc0806a72b7-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Tom Hardy as Ronnie (with spectacles) and Reggie Kray in Legend.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hardy as Ronnie (with spectacles) and Reggie Kray in Legend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/StudioCanal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reggie didn’t wear glasses, except once when he snuck into Dartmoor prison in disguise to visit Frank “The Mad Axeman” Mitchell. “Of course, I stuck a hat on and a pair of heavy glasses,” he recalled in his memoir. But Ronnie was renowned for his half-rimmed spectacles, with which he exuded an air of studious menace. “When he was in Broadmoor, he had a tortoiseshell pair,” <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/husband-ronnie-kray-wife-london-3701361\">his wife, Kate Kray, explained recently</a>, “because I wore a pair on one visit and he said he wanted glasses like mine.” Last summer, she sold off his original frames at a rural auctioneers in Towcester, Northamptonshire, but Ray-Ban makes a rather similar model.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"624e94cce029ff0fde93f89e92fe0f885397222b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440586046418/83057f31-098b-4724-bfa0-87d1e51de23d-460x221.jpeg\" alt=\"Clubmaster Ray-Bans, £79.\" width=\"460\" height=\"221\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray-Ban</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ronnie likes … </strong><a href=\"http://www.latesteyewear.co.uk/products/Ray-Ban-Clubmaster-RB5154-Red-Havana?gclid=Cj0KEQjwmNuuBRDTu5rDjr2kxJsBEiQAWlm6UqkZsx76uCEL-4adHrXyOqBvgra4z5DwwlKwrJqwZ3oaAirk8P8HAQ\">Ray-Ban Clubmasters</a>, from £79.<br /></p> <h2><strong>James Dean</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d729767ce25d014199ec8cfc2fc81a58c14f41a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440588172579/2661f55b-97c0-4275-9f72-399546a6a41a-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Life, starring Dane DeHaan as James Dean.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life, starring Dane DeHaan as James Dean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AMF Photographs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/14/life-trailer-anton-corbijn-james-dean-biopic-trailer-debut\">Anton Corbijn’s forthcoming film Life</a>, about James Dean (more specifically, about photographer Dennis Stock shooting the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/dec/06/dennis-stock-magnum-american-cool-in-pictures\">then-unknown actor for Life magazine</a>), DeHaan spends much of the time moping around in Dean’s trademark tortoiseshell spectacles, smoking cigarettes and squinting. There’s something quite cool and arty about wearing glasses and smoking. It brings to mind Andy Warhol and David Hockney, and suggests an intoxicating mix of wild nights out and nerdy afternoons in. It’s bad for your heart, but good for your sight. It suggests a very cinematic inner complexity.</p> <p><strong>James likes …</strong> <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/en-gb/mens/cutler_and_gross/tortoiseshell-square-framed-optical-glasses/604895\">Cutler and Gross square-frame glasses, £295</a>.<br /></p> <h2><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e6daea7429ec57465e04973be46532296202caa\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440587743728/ea389388-5655-4d8f-a694-e83bb0f4af6c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Steve Jobs in real life, right, and as played by Michael Fassbender, left.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Jobs in real life, right, and as played by Michael Fassbender, left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whatever you may think of Apple products, Steve Jobs certainly knew a thing or two about stylish design; his look was inspired, apparently, by a calligraphy class he took after dropping out of college. His signature black rollneck has already swept through the world of menswear: JW Anderson and Raf Simons showed variants of it on their catwalks, and everybody followed suit. Now,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/27/danny-boyle-steve-jobs-new-york-film-fest\"> with Michael Fassbender portraying the Apple founder in a second biopic</a> (this time directed by Danny Boyle, so it will be much better than the atrocious first effort, Jobs), the signature rimless spectacles are set to do the same. These are the most serious, business-like frames out there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e5e547a98d90c4e0720f9d7db65150bfbbe5f23\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440587350527/c05a826d-3c15-4408-9373-89da6db45dda-460x235.jpeg\" alt=\"Savile Row 18K Diaflex Round glasses, £266.\" width=\"460\" height=\"235\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Savile Row</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Steve likes …</strong> <a href=\"http://www.framesdirect.com/framesfp/Savile_Row-tekang/r.html\">Savile Row rimless glasses</a>, £266.</p> <h2><strong>George Falconer</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5230921dcd7db2906890e32cf8e6b72cc9428b57\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440587894135/608fa96c-1f22-4f0e-aaca-92876ccda47d-460x194.jpeg\" alt=\"Colin Firth as George in A Single Man.\" width=\"460\" height=\"194\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Firth as George in A Single Man.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tom Ford’s directorial debut A Single Man (2009) was sad, yes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/11/a-single-man-review\">but also very stylish</a>. Its abiding image was George Falconer (Colin Firth) in his suit, tie and thick, horn-rimmed vintage frames. These were extra large – allowing him to clearly see all the tragedy, regret and longing in the world. They were also very popular, so much so that Ford eventually released his own take on the classic frame: the TF 5178.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee5bc5912cdfa23c344d7426e5e24ffcda003741\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440588210824/b91b3ec8-878f-4252-926d-ffbed7c97e9c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tom Ford TF 5178 glasses, £175.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>George likes …</strong> <a href=\"https://www.toniandguy-opticians.com/product/tom-ford-designer-glasses-tf-5178\">Tom Ford horn-rimmed glasses</a>, £175.</p> <h2><strong>Harry Potter</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5602b63a8b59c643fb4e8e8a72eb64617f970665\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440588271620/d7059b91-fd43-4d47-9f34-043c0d16e427-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Really, though, if we’re thinking about glasses from recent cinema, then Harry Potter’s thin, round metal frames are the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/harrypotter\">iconic and the most magical</a>.

you’ve ever sat in a cinema wishing Peter Jackson’s Hobbit movies were just that little bit longer, your dreams are about to come true. Variety reports <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/news/the-hobbit-trilogy-returns-to-theaters-with-extended-editions-1201578073/\">all three films in the trilogy are to return to US multiplexes in extended form</a>.</p> <p>The longer editions of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug and The Battle of the Five Armies have been put together for DVD releases. But with the film saga having scored close to $3bn (£191m) at the global box office, studio Warner Bros clearly believes there will be demand for more Hobbity fun on the big screen.</p> <p>“We are excited to give fans the first chance to see the extended editions of this trilogy in cinemas,” said John Rubey of Fathom Events, which is coordinating the screenings at AMC, Regal and Cinemark multiplexes. “The incredible cinematography and action in each feature will be even better on the big screen and will give Hobbit fans a chance to binge-watch as a community.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/jan/21/week-in-geek-tolkieneditor-the-hobbit-edited-version-peter-jackson\">Cutting The Hobbit down to size: no dwarf-elf flirting, no albino orcs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An Unexpected Journey is due to debut on 5 October, with The Desolation of Smaug following two days later and The Battle of the Five Armies, which has not yet hit DVD, arriving on 13 October. The extended trilogy will be screened at 500 sites in the US, with a special introduction from Jackson preceding each showing.</p> <p>The news is somewhat controversial because the trilogy has been mired in suggestions that the films are too long, and already pads out material from JRR Tolkien’s breezy 250-page fantasy fable to preposterous length. Wags have suggested it would now take longer to watch all three extended versions – at a whopping nine hours plus – than it would to read the book.</p> <p>In January an anonymous person known only as tolkieneditor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/jan/21/week-in-geek-tolkieneditor-the-hobbit-edited-version-peter-jackson\">whittled the trilogy down to four hours</a> by removing Tauriel the she-elf’s proto-romance with hunky dwarf Kíli, most scenes of the Azog the pale orc, the White Council’s investigation/attack on Dol Guldur, several of the Laketown scenes involving Luke Evans’s Bard the Bowman and the extended prelude to An Unexpected Journey with Ian Holm as the elder Bilbo. “I felt that the story was spoiled by an interminable running time, unengaging plot tangents and constant narrative filibustering,” said the editor of his scissor-wielding frenzy.</p> <p>There’s no word yet as to whether, or when, the extended editions will hit UK cinemas.<br /></p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Peter Jackson’s movies are to return to US multiplexes with extra footage, despite complaints that the original cuts

has praised the idea of a gay 007, while admitting producers would never let it happen.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.details.com/culture-trends/celebrities/201508/pierce-brosnan-no-escape-james-bond-interview\">Interviewed in Details</a>, the 62-year-old Irish actor suggested a version of Ian Fleming’s suave super-spy with homosexual leanings would “make for interesting viewing”. But he pointed out that Bond production company Eon, in the former of long-term 007 flame-keeper Barbara Broccoli, would most likely torpedo the idea.</p> <p>“Sure. Why not?” said Brosnan, when asked if he could picture a gay Bond. After a pause he then added: “Actually, I don’t know how it would work. I don’t think Barbara would allow a gay Bond to happen in her lifetime. But it would certainly make for interesting viewing.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm93TAEgwdc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lm93TAEgwdc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The actor suggested changes to 007’s racial makeup might be a more realistic progressive goal. “Let’s start with a great black actor being James Bond,” he said. “Idris Elba certainly has the physicality, the charisma, the presence. But I think Daniel [Craig] will be there for a while yet.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/30/roger-moore-denies-racist-comments-about-idris-elba-playing-james-bond\">Roger Moore denies racist comments about Idris Elba playing James Bond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Separately, Brosnan admitted he did not see legalised gay marriage coming in his native Ireland, but had been delighted to see the law changed. “I never thought in a million years, but hallelujah! Enough of the shaming,” he said. “It’s a great indication of the forward-thinking of a nation that’s been so mangled by religion.”</p> <p>Craig himself weighed in on the idea of a gay Bond three years ago after a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm93TAEgwdc\">torture scene in 2012’s Skyfall</a> sparked speculation that his take on 007 might be bisexual. Villain Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) runs his hands over the captured spy’s torso and suggests “there is a first time for everything”, with Craig responding: “What makes you think this is my first time?” But the actor <a href=\"http://uk.eonline.com/news/361425/daniel-craig-gay-james-bond-never-going-to-happen\">told E! Online he did not think the character was gay</a>. “I don’t think Javier’s character is either – I think he’d fuck anything,” he said.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Former 007 says canonical shift would make for interesting viewing, but that the producer would never allow it – and suggests

Searchlight has bought an untitled script concerning Edith Macefield, a woman who held out against developers as they built a mall around her home. It comes from John Whittington, who is working on a Netflix series based on the Dr Seuss story Green Eggs and Ham. It will be produced by Will Gluck, who directed Emma Stone in the comedy Easy A and the musical remake Annie. A director is yet to be hired.</p> <p>The house became the centre of an unlikely story when the elderly Macefield stood her ground against developers who bought all the homes in the neighbourhood for redevelopment. She reportedly turned down $1m (£640,000) to continue living in her home, which had been standing for 100 years.</p> <p>The comedy-drama will focus on the unlikely friendship that grew between Macefield and the superintendent of the building project. Macefield, who died in 2008, left him the house in her will.</p> <p>Macefield’s story bears similarities to Pixar’s Oscar-winning hit Up, which revolved around an elderly man who refused to let developers destroy his home. Pixar have denied that the house was an inspiration, explaining its film was in the works since 2004 – two years before Macefield was approached about selling.</p> <p>The house still stands and has often been covered in balloons by fans of the film. It is now owned by a nonprofit organisation.

reveals new details of Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fans have speculated furiously over the character of Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver, whose ostentatious robes and mask appear to have a Vader-like quality. Likewise, observers have suggested Ren’s new First Order could be a direct descendent of the evil Galactic Empire featured in the original Star Wars trilogy.</p> <p>But Abrams <a href=\"http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=45203\">told Empire magazine the truth might be rather more complex</a>. “Kylo Ren is not a Sith,” said the film-maker, whose movie is released worldwide on 18 December. “He works under Supreme Leader Snoke, who is a powerful figure on the Dark Side of the Force.”</p> <p>Unlike Ren, who Abrams has previously revealed was given his second name by a mysterious group named the knights of Ren, Snoke has not yet appeared in early trailers or images. Portrayed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/29/andy-serkis-goes-back-to-mo-cap-for-new-star-wars-films\">Andy Serkis</a>, he is expected to be a CGI creature with motion-captured movements: the character was heard in the first teaser for The Force Awakens remarking on the re-emergence of the titular metaphysical energy field, “the dark side, and the light”.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/apr/16/star-wars-the-force-awakens-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/47tba\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2276974\"            data-video-name=\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens – watch the new trailer\"            data-video-provider=\"Lucasfilm\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/16/1429210903049/Still-from-Star-Wars--001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-456391321\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/16/1429210903049/Still-from-Star-Wars--001.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/04/16/150416starwars_FromGAus-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/04/16/150416starwars_FromGAus_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/04/16/150416starwars_FromGAus_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/04/16/150416starwars_FromGAus/150416starwars_FromGAus.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/04/16/150416starwars_FromGAus.webm\"></source> </video> </figure>   <p>It is not known if Snoke is connected to the First Order, but Abrams suggested the new group might be linked to the Empire in a non-linear manner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/16/disney-awakens-force-star-wars-themed-lands-disneyland\">Disney awakens the force with Star Wars-themed lands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“That all came out of conversations about what would have happened if the Nazis all went to Argentina, but started working together again,” said the director. “What could be born of that? Could the First Order exist as a group that actually admired the Empire? Could the work of the Empire be seen as unfulfilled? And could Vader be a martyr? Could there be a need to see through what didn’t get done?”</p> <p>Details of the storyline for The Force Awakens are, uncharacteristically for an Abrams film, slowly slipping out, although it’s not known how much is accurate. Two years ago, the New York-born film-maker insisted right up until the first preview screenings that Benedict Cumberbatch did not play Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness. It finally emerged that the British actor was indeed portraying the villainous figure made famous by Ricardo Montalbán in 1982’s Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Film-maker expands on idea that Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren might be something of an Anakin Skywalker fanboy in new episode of long-running space opera","headline":"JJ Abrams: Darth Vader could be 'martyr' figure in Star Wars: The Force Awakens","byline":"Ben Child","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440573773783/b0017525-6aab-4e99-880a-e75b2e79b6e9-140x84.png","commentCloseDate":"2015-08-29T08:30:00+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Film-maker expands on idea that Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren might be something of an Anakin Skywalker fanboy in new episode of long-running space opera</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/26/jj-abrams-darth-vader-could-be-martyr-figure-in-star-wars-the-force-awakens","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/aug/26/jj-abrams-darth-vader-could-be-martyr-figure-in-star-wars-the-force-awakens","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/star-wars-episode-vii","webTitle":"Star Wars: The Force Awakens","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/star-wars-episode-vii","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/star-wars-episode-vii","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/jjabrams","webTitle":"JJ Abrams","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jjabrams","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/jjabrams","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/harrisonford","webTitle":"Harrison Ford","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/harrisonford","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/harrisonford","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/sciencefictionandfantasy","webTitle":"Science fiction and fantasy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sciencefictionandfantasy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/sciencefictionandfantasy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/starwars","webTitle":"Star Wars","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/starwars","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","webTitle":"Ben Child","r2ContributorId":"24984","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/19/1426761348767/Ben-Child.jpg","firstName":"ben","lastName":"child","twitterHandle":"BenChildGeek","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Child is a Guardian film writer and the blogger behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/week-in-geek\">The Week in Geek</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[]}]},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/aug/26/notebook-the-end-of-analogue-star-wars","elements":[{"id":"c6d19b625ee5483b230b57bca99dcdc926581fce","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/25/1440526804753/Tom-Courtenay-and-Charlot-005.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/25/1440526804753/Tom-Courtenay-and-Charlot-005.jpg","source":"Guardian","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Tom Courtenay and Charlotte Rampling in 45 Years","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Guardian","caption":"Tom Courtenay and Charlotte Rampling in 45 Years.

They were taken by her husband, Tom Courtenay, when he was hiking in Switzerland with a previous girlfriend. During the trip, she fell into a glacier; her perfectly preserved body has just been unearthed. He’s finding it hard to cope. His wife likewise.</p> <p>The plot – memories put on ice, a past literally defrosted – smacks of the short story; metaphors packed tight for extra oomph. And, sure enough, 45 Years is adapted from one. But the slides scene doesn’t feature in the book. Rather, the awful info Rampling gleans from the images is just told to her straight by her husband.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>In 45 years time, Rampling's character would just swipe through Courtenay's Instagram rather than plug in a projector</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So what we have here, then, categorically, is the most inspired book-to-movie improvement ever in the history of cinema. It is an absolutely terrifying few minutes. The level of dread, already high, is soundtracked by the mini-guillotine whirr and click of the machine. It all plays out in very slow strobe – a brief plunge into total darkness punctuating every picture. A relationship drama becomes a horror film. The bogeyman intermittently glimpsed beneath a dodgy basement lightbulb.</p> <p>In 45 years’ time, such a scene won’t be possible. Rampling’s character would just swipe through Courtenay’s Instagram, clocking the comments, zooming in with finger and thumb, maybe annotating with a sad-face emoji. There would be no need to unhook a loft ladder or plug in a projector. No special audio or light effects. No sound at all.</p> <p>The noise of analogue is something I’m really going to miss, should I live that long. Hardware beeping and groaning back at you, humming its own little tune.

Studios, understandably reluctant to let little things like rigor mortis get in the way of bums on seats, have begun meticulously recreating the deceased via the magic of CGI – and their pool of candidates is pushing further back into the past.

Cushing had unusually whopping feet, and the riding boots of his official costume pinched. So he lobbied George Lucas to only shoot him from the thighs up, or at least edit out his lower legs, enabling him to stalk about the set in carpet slippers (a brown pair, on display at<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCT-m1syObE\" title=\"\"> an exhibition in Whitstable</a> a few years ago).</p> <p>The producers ought, of course, to embrace this – to run with the footwear.

That’s the draw behind American Ultra, in which small-town stoner loser Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) discovers that he’s a sleeper agent with amazing assassin powers of destruction. The trailer is a series of comic set pieces in which Mike, much to his own surprise, kills people with a spoon, frying pan and other sundries. “These sleeper agents live among us. They could be your friend. Your family. Or the person you least expect.” Awesome, dude.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/18/american-ultra-review-jesse-eisenberg-kristen-stewart\">American Ultra review: bong ho action comedy puts Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart in a stupor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>American Ultra isn’t the only film which thinks this is awesome. At least since Robert Ludlum’s 1980 spy thriller The Bourne Identity was published, the spy genre has gleefully distributed fancy martial arts abilities to unsuspecting amnesiacs. The 2002 Bourne Identity film and the 1990 sci-fi/spy flick Total Recall (based very loosely on a 1972 Philip K Dick short story) are two high-profile examples.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"836fb09d617eea6e9c0cd5040f84194bad0b19eb\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/19/1439989870173/91c88f08-b953-4523-8c45-85042e7c23fd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"I'll be back … where am I again?\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I’ll be back … where am I again?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the most direct precursor for American Ultra in the incongruous everyperson superspy sub-genre may be the The Long Kiss Goodnight. In the 1996 film, Geena Davis plays suburban housewife Sam. Sam is an amnesiac, and as she recovers her memory, she discovers that she is actually sexy superspy bad girl Charly Baltimore. </p> <p>The double identity is played in the film mostly for angst – but it’s also, clearly, an attraction. Sam is gleeful as she suddenly realizes that she can wield a brutally efficient knife while cutting vegetables in the kitchen – and what middle-class dull bourgeois, of whatever gender, wouldn’t like to take a week off to smoke cigarettes, change hairstyles, look hot and shoot some bad guys?</p> <p>This is the central fantasy of all spy action thrillers. James Bond, Mission Impossible – whatever your franchise of choice, the pleasure is in identifying with some mysterious, ultra-competent , ultra-slick protagonist, whose body is a weapon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e2d7a1b0-b04f-48ae-88a0-9f85817ae4b7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/19/1439994137430/ffdb1f28-0121-4c18-a303-d2127a6c4198-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geena Davis in The Long Kiss Goodnight, Renny Harlin’s 1996 thriller about a teacher waking up to her assassin past.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The brilliance of the amnesiac spy trope is that it makes that identification the quietly meta center of the story. In The Bourne Identity, Jason Bourne wakes up not knowing who he is or where he came from. His position, in other words, is exactly the position of the reader, who opens a book (or starts watching a movie) without any information about the fictional world (trailers excepted.) Bourne is the reader; he has to move forward page by page, discovering not just the plot, but the backstory as he goes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/25/total-recall-remake-forget-it\">Total Recall - a remake to forget</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And part of what he discovers is that he is mutliple identities; Jason Bourne is also agent Cain and, somewhere down there, a guy named David. In amnesiac stories, the multiple-identity double and triple agents of spy novels become a metaphor for the audience, all of whom get to change identities, too. In The Long Kiss Goodnight, Sam the schoolteacher was originally a cover story for Charly; Jason Bourne was originally a cover story for David. Similarly, Charly is a cover story for every audience member. You, the viewer, may in your daily life take your kids to the ice-skating rink or sell stuff at a convenience store. But when you dim the lights you know that your real identity is up there, on the screen, killing people with a spoon.</p> <p>The dynamic is similar to superhero comics: Clark Kent exists so you can imagine that anyone can be Superman.

any more?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Studio Warner Bros has hired Emmy nominee Tony Cervone to direct the new big-screen effort, the latest in a series of abortive attempts to bring the long-running Hanna-Barbera cartoon back to multiplexes. Warner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/aug/27/scooby-doo-new-animated-film\">tried to get an animated film off the ground</a> in August 2013, but then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/18/scooby-doo-movie-animation-live-action\">shifted attention to a new live action/CGI iteration</a> in June last year, according to reports at the time. The studio now appears to have returned to its original plan.</p> <p>Scooby-Doo starred in two live action/CGI hybrids movies over a decade ago, with 2002’s Scooby-Doo and 2004 sequel Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed taking more than £455m at the global box office overall, despite generally negative reviews. Both films starred the husband and wife pairing of Freddie Prinze Jr (Fred) and Sarah Michelle Gellar (Daphne), along with Matthew Lillard (Shaggy) and Linda Cardellini (Velma), as Scooby’s teenage paranormal investigator pals. Australian actor Neil Fanning voiced Scooby.</p> <p>Cervone is a Scooby-Doo veteran, who has worked on a pair of small-screen films starring the craven hound, 2010’s Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo and last year’s Scooby-Doo! and Kiss: Rock and Roll Mystery. Warner hopes the film will pave the way for the studio to usher in a new wave of movies based on its rights to the Hanna-Barbera back catalogue, which includes 1960s and 70s classics such as The Flintstones, Tom and Jerry, Wacky Races, Top Cat, Hong Kong Phooey, Captain Caveman and The Jetsons.</p> <p>The new Scooby-Doo film, for which no cast details are yet available, is scheduled to be released in 2018.<br /></p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Studio Warner Bros hires small-screen veteran Tony Cervone, who has worked on two television films about

girls. </p> <p>Which, obviously, has nothing to do with age. Frankly, this demand for strong, interesting female leads also has nothing to do with bangs, affinity for the Shins, or the giggle-fuelled spontaneity that’s come to define decades of female characters looking to be anchored by a man. (No matter how eternally soul-searching these men may be.) Nope: after a lifetime of movies like The Apartment, Annie Hall, and (500) Days of Summer, we needed women who were willing to find themselves before finding their partner’s self first. We needed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/16/why-the-manic-pixie-dream-girl-must-never-return\">Manic Pixie Dream Girls</a> to become women, because that’s what all women deserved.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/16/why-the-manic-pixie-dream-girl-must-never-return\">Why the Manic Pixie Dream Girl must never return</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thankfully, summer 2015 was ready. And this made sense, considering there was no way we could possibly return to our bleak, MPDG-ridden pasts – especially after 2014 delivered complex women like Amy Dunne in Gone Girl, Maggie Dean in The Skeleton Twins, and Cheryl Strayed (based on the real Cheryl Strayed) in Wild. So instead, this season stepped up its game. Greta Gerwig’s turn as Brooke in Mistress America proved her ability to figure out her own life (or attempt to) without the heroism of a man. Minnie (Bel Powley) electrified audiences in Diary of a Teenage Girl and reaffirmed that young women who are reconciling their relationship with sex aren’t necessarily looking for or even in need of a relationship. Amy (Schumer) in Trainwreck may have embraced the idea of true love, but not after she looked at her own life and chose to rebuild it accordingly. Even Cara Delevingne, as the elusive Margo in Paper Towns, manages to stare down the film’s hero while informing him that he loves the idea of her, not her as a whole.<br /></p> <p>In fact, regardless of genre, the most talked-about summer movies seemed to channel their inner Margos. Mission Impossible’s Isla proved herself not just a worthy adversary, but a worthier ally whom Tom Cruise’s character understands is his professional equal and not his love interest. Gaby in The Man From UNCLE outsmarts the Russians and Americans at the behest of the British (while opting out of a romantic dalliance with Russian spy Iliya). And we all know Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road only allowed Max to stick around because of his reliability.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/mistress-america-review-anxieties-of-youth-and-middle-age-on-a-wave-of-zane\">Mistress America review – anxieties of youth and middle age on a wave of zane</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what makes these women multidimensional and compelling is also their willingness to be vulnerable. While Manic Pixie Dream Girls were based around emotion (or the emotions a male lead would project upon them), their writers also failed to let them embrace their flaws – or worse, writers had men over-romanticize said flaws until the MPDG needed rescuing (as in Penny Lane’s overdose in Almost Famous or the case of Sam in Garden State, who’s left crying in a telephone booth). This summer, leading women have been allowed – or more specifically, encouraged – to make mistakes. (Because how else does anybody learn?) Minnie agrees not to repeat the sexual encounter she has in a restroom; Amy realizes she needs to stop drinking so much; Margo refuses to apologize to Quentin for leaving their hometown under the cloak of darkness. Which means that finally, leading women aren’t just being written as women, but as people. And this means that as people, they’re given the universal right to screw up, to learn, to grow, and to repeat accordingly. This summer, a woman’s job isn’t to make a man feel valued. Her role has not been created to validate a guy who feels lost or misunderstood. She’s not armed with headphones, encouraging everyone around her to listen to some band that will for sure “change their lives”. If she’s listening to anything, it’s what’s on her own iPod, and she certainly doesn’t have time to hand it over to you.<br /></p> <p>This summer, writers have finally let the Manic Pixie Dream Girl evolve into a grown-ass woman. And as we’ve learned through the the past few seasons of movies and TV, these grown-ass women are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves – or, in the case of Mistress America, themselves and younger, wide-eyed stepsisters, too.<br /></p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"The tired archetype has been replaced by a woman not so easily reducible to a catchphrase
