</strong>Pensionable – the airline is 65 years old this year.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Ghastly, with most of its rather small roster of aircraft purchased from the Soviet Union after the end of the cold war.</p> <p><strong>Ooh, an aeroplane? Because I am thinking of going on holiday, as it happens.</strong> How lovely. Where to? The party island of Ibiza? The celebrated seafood trail of the Scottish lochs? The Maldives, while some of its islands are still above water?</p> <p><strong>No, I’ve decided to swim against the tide and head for North Korea. </strong>Right. That whole tense <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/26/north-korea-deal-diplomacy-on-peninsula\" title=\"\">entente-cordiale-of-sorts-with-neighbouring-South-Korea</a> thing not dissuading you, then?</p> <p><strong>No, if anything the ever-present threat of war with them, and, indeed, pretty much everyone else on the planet, adds to the frisson.</strong> And you are not put off by the fact that <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/04/130406-north-korea-kim-jung-un-counterfeit-gulag-world-facts/\" title=\"\">wearing jeans is illegal and you’re not allowed to talk to the locals</a>?</p> <p><strong>I will wear sensible slacks and maintain an air of unapproachable froideur. </strong>OK, well, if the need for comfortable trousers and lack of human interaction is not enough to put you off, maybe you ought to consider the fact that you’ll have to travel with Air Koryo, North Korea’s state airline.</p> <p><strong>Sounds lovely. Does Kim Jong-un do the flight-safety video?</strong> That might not make a whole heap of difference. Air Koryo has been named as the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/11823302/The-worlds-worst-airlines.html?frame=3072040\" title=\"\">worst airline on the planet for the fourth year running</a>. Indeed, it is the only airline on said planet to be given just one star by the <a href=\"http://www.airlinequality.com/ratings/a-z-airline-rating/\" title=\"\">Skytrax rating system</a>.</p> <p><strong>Oh. And that’s out of how many airlines? </strong>197.</p> <p><strong>Oh dear. Well – ha ha! - it can’t possibly be worse than … </strong>Ryanair? You couldn’t be more wrong. The much-maligned Irish chaps were one of 22 airlines to be awarded two stars, which means that Air Koryo is precisely half as good as Ryanair.</p> <p><strong>Blimey. And all because the planes are a bit long in the tooth? </strong>Nope, the Skytrax report also cites “questionable” safety and rudimentary safety belts, which is why pretty much all of Air Koryo’s planes are banned in the European Union because they’re a horrendous risk.</p> <p><strong>Ah well, Ibiza it is then.</strong></p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I seem to have left my boarding pass in my illegal jeans.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Hey, look! Asiana Airlines in South Korea got five stars from Skytrax! Go South Korea!”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10716302","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-27T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2360537","internalContentCode":"457804256","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The North Korean carrier has come bottom of an annual league table for world airlines for the fourth time.

</strong>At least 2,400 years old.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Curly, green and, for the past few years, ubiquitous.</p> <p><strong>Someone tried to serve me kale roulade at a dinner party last week. I had to, er, leave.</strong> You might be able to stay put at the next one – a kale crisis looms.</p> <p><strong>Really? Tell me more! </strong>A dry summer and an EU ban on nicotinoid pesticides means that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3209697/Aphid-plague-worst-ten-years-Explosion-insects-lead-shortage-vegetables-including-cauliflower-broccoli.html\" title=\"\">a plague of aphids is upon us</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/05/celebrity-endorsements-kale-cool\">Celebrity endorsements make kale cool again </a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>And what? Don’t tell me – hipster cafes were frying them in a light tempura batter and sprinkling them atop kale salads. Without them, the snack du jour is ruined.</strong> No. Much simpler. Not a modern tale, but one as old as time – the insects have attacked brassica crops, including cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage, as well as kale. Unless growing conditions remain perfect from hereon out, this will cause a superfood shortage.</p> <p><strong>How will all the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gwynethpaltrow\" title=\"\"><strong>Gwyneth</strong></a><strong>-a-likes manage? </strong>It doesn’t bear thinking about. Where will they get their daily doses of beta-carotene, vitamin K, vitamin C, sulforaphane, indole-3-carbinol and bile acid sequestrants now?</p> <p><strong>And smugness. Don’t forget the smugness.</strong> You would be smug, too, if you were banishing cancer, wrinkles, bowel woes and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/07/gwyneth-paltrow-juice-recipes\" title=\"\">cholesterol in one fell swoop</a>.</p> <p><strong>And joy. You banish joy if you’re forever chewing on a fibrous bale of bitter greens.</strong> There are lots of ways to improve those aspects of this wonderfood.</p> <p><strong>Mm-hm. Any of them wholly successful? </strong>The Italian method of calling it cavolo nero and drowning small portions of it in cream, cheese, olive oil and spaghetti seems to work best.</p> <p><strong>I am almost persuaded.</strong> And in Sweden, they chop it up, fry it with cream, pepper and syrup. That’s called langkal.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Ah, Swedish for: “Let’s address this problem head on – ADD SUGAR!” I presume. </strong>But really, you should try my local cafe’s kale, oat and banana smoothie. It’s to die for, if it wasn’t going to make you live for ever.</p> <p><strong>You should try my local cafe’s egg, bacon and hash browns. You will die, but happy.</strong></p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I add kale to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/30/sorry-gwyneth-paltrow-but-steaming-your-vagina-is-a-bad-idea\" title=\"\">my morning vaginal steam</a>.

<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Hipsterish, dressed in black T-shirts, usually found in California, though also increasingly visible in cities in India and China.</p> <p><strong>Pointy thing on the forehead, I seem to recall: </strong>Er, no, you are thinking of the mythical white horse that features in the literature of the ancient world. The modern unicorns – privately owned high-tech companies valued at $1bn or more – are resolutely modern.</p> <p><strong>So why are they called unicorns? </strong>Because when American venture capitalist <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/\">Aileen Lee coined the term two years ago</a>, she could find only 39 in the US. Since she reckoned 60,000 software and internet companies had been “seeded” in the previous decade, that meant only 0.07 had grown into billion-dollar companies – hence they were as rare as unicorns.</p> <p><strong>And are they still? </strong>Apparently not. <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies\">At the last count, there were 131</a>, and they are growing by at least 50 a year. “Unicorns are becoming so common, maybe we should just call them horses,” is one Silicon Valley joke.</p> <p><strong>How droll. </strong>There is even a new terminology springing up to describe the market: “narwhals” are companies valued at more than $500m; “decacorns” are companies valued at more than $10bn. No one has yet come up with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\">a word for Uber</a>, which is valued at more than $50bn.</p> <p><strong>Who cares? This is boring. </strong>True, but it matters because it could have the makings of another <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/23/nasdaq-new-record-high-dotcom-bubble\">dotcom bubble</a>. “We may be nearing the end of a cycle where growth is valued more than profitability,” investment guru <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgurley/status/634572713168793600\">Bill Gurley tweeted last week</a>. “It could be at an inflection point.”</p> <p><strong>An inflection point? </strong>I think it means everything is about to go belly-up.</p> <p><strong>Maybe the stock market collapse in China could be another indicator. </strong>I see you’ve been reading the FT after all.</p> <p><strong>What is this growth v profitability thing? </strong>Unicorns usually pursue market share rather than profit – for a digital startup, dominating your sector is everything. As a result, you can be valued at billions without ever making a cent. But eventually, investors might start fretting about the bottom line.</p> <p><strong>And then? </strong>Gurley reckons there are going to be lots of “dead unicorns” and “zombie unicorns” – and quite a few burnt investors.</p> <p><strong>Not to be confused with: </strong>The real world.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“It’s a dangerous spike.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Isn’t this a bit recherché for Pass notes? Perhaps we should have done Usain Bolt instead.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10710429","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2359315","internalContentCode":"457789817","publication":"The

air-conditioning company.</p> <p><strong>Famous for: </strong>Running.</p> <p><strong>Go on. </strong>He was a fantastic runner, if you like that sort of thing.</p> <p><strong>Which you don’t?</strong> Personally, I have never seen the point of running round in circles, but some people – especially self-promoting governments – are keen.</p> <p><strong>Isn’t Coe a bit old to be a runner? </strong>He did all his track running 30 years ago – winning successive Olympic 1500m titles – but never really stopped despite retiring from athletics in 1990.</p> <p><strong>I sense you are trying to make some clever link here.</strong> Since 1990, he has devoted himself to running for office: Conservative MP from 1992-97; became a Tory peer in 2000; chaired the organising committee of the London Olympics; became vice-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2007, and this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2015/aug/19/sebastian-coe-elected-president-of-iaaf-video\">was elected its president</a>.</p> <p><strong>A high achiever. </strong>That’s one way of putting it.</p> <p><strong>You don’t like him, do you?</strong> He’s just too damned perfect. In his great rivalry with Steve Ovett in the 1980s, it was fashionable to support Ovett – the prickly, gap-toothed outsider – and deride the super-smooth Coe.</p> <p><strong>Sounds like random prejudice. </strong>Of course. He was portrayed as the archetypal posh Englishman, but his mother is anglo-Indian, he failed his 11-plus and went to a Sheffield comp.</p> <p><strong>Tough with a name like Sebastian Newbold. </strong>He says you had to learn to fight or to run. He ran.</p> <p><strong>Are you going to mention drugs?</strong> Ah yes, the burning topic in Coe’s presidential intray. The sport’s credibility has been threatened by recent allegations of widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs.</p> <p><strong>What was his reaction?</strong> Initially he called them a “declaration of war” on the sport, but he is now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/19/sebastian-coe-doping-loopholes-iaaf-president\">promising more anti-doping resources</a> and says he will make athletics “relevant” to young people.</p> <p><strong>How?</strong> Maybe athletes will have to run while texting and taking selfies.</p> <p><strong>What will he do next?</strong> Probably nothing. “After so many races run, this might be my last race,” he told delegates. Presidents of the IAAF tend to stay in office longer than your average African despot.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“What a hero.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Where is Steve Ovett these days?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10695287","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-20T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2356949","internalContentCode":"457763816","publication":"The

Is it because she’s a woman? </strong>It’s because you asked me about it. Oh. And because she’s an actor, and as she <a href=\" http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-08-10/natalie-dormer-game-of-thrones-violence-isnt-gratuitous---films-like-superman-are-worse\">told the Radio Times</a>, “It’s a visual medium, so to a certain extent you get judged on the way you look … It’s not just about bed-ability: it’s about your physicality more generally.”</p> <p><strong>I see. From what things might I remember her? </strong>Game of Thrones mainly, in which she plays scheming serial-wife Margaery Tyrell. She’s also in the later Hunger Games movies.</p> <p><strong>Anything not about games?</strong> The Tudors, in which she was Anne Boleyn. <a href=\"bbc http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2015/33/the-scandalous-lady-w\">The Scandalous Lady W</a>, a new BBC drama about Lady Worsley, a noted 18th-century shagger, is on TV on Monday night.</p> <p><strong>Anything that isn’t about saucy dressing up?</strong> Not much that gets famous, no. “I’d made a small pledge to myself to keep away from corsets for a bit,” she <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11790651/Natalie-Dormer-Sex-and-romance-is-a-huge-part-of-human-motivation.html\">told the Telegraph</a>, but she changed her mind for Lady W.</p> <p><strong>Don’t you think she’s letting women down by allowing herself to be an object of male desire? </strong>Don’t you think that’s slut-shaming?</p> <p><strong>Actually I’m not sure I feel like getting into this. </strong>Too late.</p> <p><strong>OK. Well, in that case, let Dormer do the talking. </strong>“My personal experience has been to work on phenomenal jobs in which the men are objectified as much as the women. Actors suffer from it, too. Wasn’t there a thing about Aidan Turner in Poldark?”</p> <p><strong>Just a bit. So basically she thinks her Games of Thrones co-star Kit Harington should stop moaning about being “</strong><a href=\"http://uk.eonline.com/news/644170/kit-harington-game-of-thrones-jon-snow-changes-his-mind-about-being-called-a-hunk-find-out-why\"><strong>put on a pedestal as a hunk</strong></a><strong>” as he did earlier this year? </strong>Effectively. She thinks people fancying each other is fairly fundamental. Or in her words: “Sex and romance is a huge part of human motivation.”</p> <p><strong>Didn’t she also say, with reference to this complex and controversial subject: “I’m scared of giving you a sound bite”?</strong> I really can’t remember.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Why can’t we just sexually objectify everybody equally?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “All right.

Closes do better in Scotland, and roads are the most expensive, relatively speaking, in Northern Ireland.</p> <p><strong>This is a load of old boulevards. Do you think any of the millions of people trying to get a home, any sort of home, in Britain care about this? Lanes, ways, crescents, avenues ... they’re desperate to live anywhere.

It’s August.</p> <p><strong>Splendid. Now tell me what it is.</strong> An unspecified number of people at airports are refusing to show their boarding passes in duty free shops when asked.</p> <p><strong>I thought we all had to? Isn’t it for security? Or how they can tell you’re a traveller and thus entitled to duty free?</strong> No! That’s what everybody thinks but it isn’t true! The whole thing is a great big late-capitalist lie!</p> <p><strong>All right, calm down. What is the truth then? </strong>The truth is that these so-called “duty-free shops” don’t have to pay VAT on sales to people leaving the EU, so they ask to see people’s boarding passes in order to establish which purchases are eligible.</p> <p><strong>Sounds good. The shop pays less tax, I pay less money.</strong> Ah, but do you? A lot of shops just charge the same price and pocket the savings. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/retailers-told-to-come-clean-after-being-accused-of-pocketing-millions-from-vat-discounts-on-airport-dutyfree-sales-10446111.html\" title=\"\">The Independent singles out Boots, WH Smith and Dixons</a> among the offenders.</p> <p><strong>But this is naked brigandry!</strong> Some people take that view. For their part, the shops insist that they pass the saving on evenly throughout their stores, that their stuff is still cheap by high street standards, and anyway offering different prices to different customers is a faff. Or as WH Smith put it, a “practical impossibility”.</p> <p><strong>Yeah right. I bet a lot of people feel misled anyway. </strong>Probably. “Dozens of readers have come forward to say they will refuse to show their boarding cards in future,” <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/air-travellers-refusing-to-show-boarding-passes-at-airport-shops-after-news-that-the-information-is-used-by-stores-to-avoid-paying-vat-10449107.html\" title=\"\">the Independent reports</a>.</p> <p><strong>That sounds rather vague.</strong> OK, well, the Telegraph has conducted <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11796026/VAT-revolt-as-thousands-refuse-to-show-boarding-passes-to-airport-shops.html\" title=\"\">its own reader poll</a>, in which 85% of people said that they will no longer show their boarding passes either.</p> <p><strong>Ha! That’ll bring the fat cats to their knees! How have they responded? </strong>They’ve said it’s fine. “Any of our customers that do not wish to share this information can shop with us without the boarding card being scanned”, said Boots.</p> <p><strong>Oh. </strong>Indeed.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “You’d like to see my boarding pass? Certainly …”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“…JUST PRISE IT FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS!”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10669793","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-12T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2352536","internalContentCode":"457707079","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Many air travellers at UK airports think they have to show their boarding passes when asked for them in shops.
