There was only the odd time I bought it but it seemed a better read than other newspapers. I'd visit the website every day and dedicate half an hour to an hour to reading it. My favourite sections are the Weekend magazine and Family, which is one of the best things about the Guardian: the topics it deals with are not always easy reading but it's a humbling read.</p><p>My favourite writers include Gary Younge – he always seems to have a unique take – and I enjoy George Monbiot because he isn't scared to criticise the left when he feels they are being hypocritical. Sarfraz Manzoor's articles are also always special and relatable being a fellow British Asian.</p><p>I read the paper mostly online but if I have a long trip ahead I might buy it. Twitter is another reason I read it a lot. I follow Guardian news, Family, G2, Weekend, Sport, Comment is free, so I'm constantly getting updates on the latest articles. I feel kind of empty when I haven't checked the Guardian Weekend, like something's missing from my week.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"6576204","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"1791616","internalContentCode":"395094759","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Zubair Limbada, 22, who recently graduated with a degree in psychology and works part time at Waitrose, likes to stay plugged in to the news","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Good to meet you … Zubair Limbada","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Interview by Raziye Akkoc","commentable":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345731609560/Good-to-meet-you---Zubair-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"43","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-27T20:00:01Z","standfirst":"Zubair Limbada, 22, who recently graduated with a degree in psychology and works part time at Waitrose, likes to stay plugged in to the news","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-21T06:50:47Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/24/good-to-meet-you-zubair-limbada","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2012/aug/24/good-to-meet-you-zubair-limbada","sectionName":"From the Guardian","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-395102817","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345731609560/Good-to-meet-you---Zubair-004.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","source":"Public Domain","altText":"Good to meet you … Zubair Limbada","height":"84","credit":"Public Domain","caption":"Good to meet you … Zubair Limbada","width":"140"}}]},{"id":"gu-image-395102816","relation":"body","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345731605154/Good-to-meet-you---Zubair-001.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","source":"Public Domain","altText":"Good to meet you … Zubair Limbada","height":"220","credit":"Public Domain","caption":"Good to meet you … Zubair Limbada","width":"140"}}]}],"tags":[{"id":"theguardian/series/good-to-meet-you","webTitle":"Good to meet you","description":"In this column Guardian readers describe their relationship with the newspaper","type":"series","sectionId":"theguardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/series/good-to-meet-you","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/series/good-to-meet-you","sectionName":"From the Guardian","references":[]},{"id":"media/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/theguardian","sectionName":"Media","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/media","sectionName":"Media","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","webTitle":"Editorials & reply","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","sectionName":"From the Guardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","sectionName":"News","references":[]},{"id":"profile/raz-akkoc","webTitle":"Raziye Akkoc","r2ContributorId":"48406","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/6/1325871273863/Raziye_Akkoc.jpg","firstName":"raziye","lastName":"akkoc","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Raziye Akkoc is a journalist working at The Telegraph.
