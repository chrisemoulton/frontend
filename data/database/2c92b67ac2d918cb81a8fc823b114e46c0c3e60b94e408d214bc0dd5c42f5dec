has learned nothing from Anders Breivik massacre, says author","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-08-28T10:30:02Z","fields":{"wordcount":"820","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4bqym","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Norway has learned nothing from the terrible events of 22 July 2011, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/anders-behring-breivik\">Anders Breivik</a> killed 77 young people on the island of Utøya, according to Norwegian author and journalist Åsne Seierstad.</p> <p>“We are hiding it under the carpet and I don’t think we have learned anything from it,” the writer told the <a href=\"https://www.edbookfest.co.uk/\">Edinburgh international book festival</a>.<br /></p> <p>“To some extent it wants to forget about it,” she said of Norway’s reaction to the horror. “It doesn’t want to deal with what happened.”<br /></p> <p>Seierstad, a foreign correspondent in Russia, China, Kosovo and Afghanistan before she turned her attention to the shattering events in Oslo and on Utøya, painstakingly researched Breivik’s life and the events leading up to the massacre for her book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/26/one-of-us-the-story-of-anders-breivik-massacre-norway-asne-seierstad-review\">One of Us: the Story of Anders Breivik and the Massacre in Norway</a>.</p> <p>She also researched the lives of those who had been murdered, talking at length to the families of the dead, keen to represent them as “not just victims being hunted”. Though the events she was describing were “as terrible as it gets”, it had been rewarding, she said, to meet the parents and learn about the lives of the young people who had been attending the Labour party’s summer youth camp. The family members were given the right of veto over Seierstad’s manuscript; none of them exerted it and royalties from the book are to be donated to charities of the families’ choosing.<br /></p> <p>The inadequate and slow police response to reports of the killings had been particularly notable, she said: “It wasn’t just one person who didn’t do his job but 35 or 40,” she said. There had been what she called a “wait-and-see attitude” – but for every minute wasted, another life had been lost.<br /></p> <p>Security measures had not been much altered in Norway as a response to the tragedy, she said – politicians deciding that to increase security for obvious targets of terrorism would increase the risk for softer targets such as schools and kindergartens.<br /></p> <p>Seierstad, whose previous book was the bestselling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/13/bookseller-of-kabul-author-cleared\">The Bookseller of Kabul</a>, also said that Breivik had much in common with Islamic State. “He was building a new state in his head,” she said. His fantasy Europe was white and Christian, in which apostates would be killed, or in certain cases forced to pay special taxes: a kind of reverse image of Isis’s vision.<br /></p> <p>And yet the violent anti-Islamic rhetoric that he espoused was not the most important motivation for the killings, she had concluded.<br /></p> <p>After examining Breivik’s life in detail – including speaking to his mother days before she died from cancer – she found “a childhood that a child shouldn’t have”. Breivik was the son of a dysfunctional marriage that, when it ended, left him alone with his troubled mother, who had probably been the victim of childhood abuse.<br /></p> <p>At the age of four, the child had already been monitored by social services, and his inability to smile, play or connect with other people noted. His mother ricocheted between signs of hatred for her son – telling him she wished he had never been born – and displays of affection. “Love hate, love hate: the worst thing you can do to a child,” said Seierstad.<br /></p> <p>Having been denied the opportunity to form relationships with his parents, he then struggled to relate to other children. A pattern was formed in which Breivik attempted to befriend, or failing that, impress, peers: first schoolmates, then contacts made online through games such as World of Warcraft; and later those he met on the web via rightwing and anti-Islamic groups. “If you are not loved you want to be admired; if you are not admired you want to be feared, in the end,” said Seierstad.<br /></p> <p>Having failed to connect with the people around him, he also failed to connect with wider society: “His hatred for society, for social democracy and Norway came so much earlier than his anti-Muslim and anti-immigration ideas,” she said, although these thoughts had formed the basis of a series of texts, distributed electronically on the day of the massacre, setting forth his views.<br /></p> <p>Seierstad said that she had believed Breivik to be gay for some time, but at length rejected the idea. “He was not afraid of women – just afraid. He was afraid of getting close to people and being unmasked,” she said.<br /></p> <p>His attempts to show off to those he encountered and attempted to befriend were rebuffed.<br /></p> <p>Even when he forayed to “the darker sides of the internet” – sites where conspiracy theories and fantasies about Muslims taking Europe were shared– he was rejected. “Not because he was so weird, but because he was so boring,” said Seierstad. She said that she believed that Breivik was not in fact truly committed to the anti-Islamic rhetoric he espoused. “He was never racist”, she said, but it was among the far right that “he met his crew of hatred”.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Åsne Seierstad, author of a detailed study of the killer and his background, tells Edinburgh book festival audience ‘we are hiding it under a carpet’","headline":"Norway has learned nothing from Anders Breivik massacre, says author","byline":"Charlotte Higgins","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f80ee8a05089fe04100d239d42aba57bf3d7d246/0_137_3984_2392/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-09-04T00:00:00+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Åsne Seierstad, author of a detailed study of the killer and his background, tells Edinburgh book festival audience ‘we are hiding it under a carpet’</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/28/norway-has-learned-nothing-from-anders-breivik-massacre-says-author","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/aug/28/norway-has-learned-nothing-from-anders-breivik-massacre-says-author","sectionName":"Books","tags":[{"id":"books/edinburgh-book-festival","webTitle":"Edinburgh international book festival","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/edinburgh-book-festival","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/edinburgh-book-festival","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/edinburghfestival","webTitle":"Edinburgh festival","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburghfestival","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/edinburghfestival","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/anders-behring-breivik","webTitle":"Anders Behring Breivik","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/anders-behring-breivik","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/anders-behring-breivik","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"world/norway","webTitle":"Norway","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/norway","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/norway","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/charlottehiggins","webTitle":"Charlotte Higgins","rcsId":"GNL465906","r2ContributorId":"15476","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749330213/CharlotteHiggins.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736088/CharlotteHiggins.png","firstName":"","lastName":"higgins","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Charlotte Higgins is the chief culture writer of the Guardian and a member of its editorial board. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/oct/11/resource\">Full profile</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/charlottehiggins","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/charlottehiggins","references":[]}]},{"id":"books/2015/aug/28/ian-mcewan-first-love-last-rites-40-years-since-publication","elements":[{"id":"39cac2aef8dd9ff335c6da42c925906d6fa25eb0","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2015/8/27/1440688504927/Ian-McEwan-in-April-1976-005.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2015/8/27/1440688504927/Ian-McEwan-in-April-1976-005.jpg","source":"John McGrath","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Ian McEwan in April 1976","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: John McGrath","caption":"Ian McEwan in April 1976.

I had come to do an MA in English at the University of East Anglia, but my overriding purpose was to write fiction. At the end of my first week, with all arrangements made, I sat down at a card table by the end of my bed one evening and told myself that I would work continuously through the night until I had completed an entire short story. I had no notes, only a scrap, a dreamy notion of what sort of story this would be.</p> <p>Within an hour, a strange voice was talking to me from the page. I let it speak. I worked on into the night, filled with a romantic sense of myself, the writer heroically driven by a compelling idea, pushing on towards dawn as the city slept. I finished around 6 o’clock.</p> <p>The story was called “Conversation with a Cupboard Man”, one of a handful I wrote that year that went into my first book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/first-love-last-rites.html\" title=\"\"><em>First Love, Last Rites</em></a>, published in 1975. Its narrator was a man who didn’t want to grow up – a strange choice for me because I considered myself that year to have finally reached adult independence. Being in Norwich was the first major decision I’d taken in my life without reference to or advice from anyone else. I wanted a fresh start after undergraduate life. I regarded myself as a full-time committed writer. An MA was what I could do in my spare time. An academic grant would support me.</p> <p>Other strange voices, other weird or wretched characters, surfaced in that year to haunt or infest my fiction. Violent, sexually perverse, lonely, they were remote from the life I was living in Norwich at the time. I was meeting many new friends, falling in love, keenly reading contemporary American fiction, hiking the North Norfolk coast, had taken a hallucinogenic drug in the countryside and been amazed – and yet whenever I returned to my notebook or typewriter, a savage, dark impulse took hold of me. Sibling incest, cross-dressing, a rat that torments young lovers, actors making love mid-rehearsal, children roasting a cat, child abuse and murder, a man who keeps a penis in a jar and uses esoteric geometry to obliterate his wife – however dark the stories were, I also thought elements in them were hilarious. Sometimes I persuaded myself I was some kind of wild man, a <em>fauviste</em>, kicking against the bourgeois divorce novel that people complained about.</p> <p>Forty years on from the publication of that little volume of stories, I’m bound to have a different view. Of course, English literary culture in 1970 was far more diverse than the so-called Hampstead divorce novel. The 2010 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/lost-booker-prize\" title=\"\">“lost Booker”</a> shortlist was powerful proof of that. Besides, divorce is a rich subject, Hampstead a legitimate place. Up until my arrival in Norwich I’d been an intense, somewhat shy or reserved child and teenager. I hadn’t caused much trouble, had uncomplainingly passed through the educational mill, and come to sex and drugs later than most – respectively, at 18 and 21. Fiction was part of a genial explosion in my life, of a sense that with my formal education more or less over, I could do whatever I wanted.</p> <p>And as far as I was concerned, fiction was synonymous with freedom. The legal struggles to publish Joyce’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ulysses-8.html\" title=\"\"><em>Ulysses</em></a>, the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/lady-chatterley-s-lover-8.html\" title=\"\"><em>Lady Chatterley</em></a> trial, the wild transgressions of books such as Roth’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/portnoy-s-complaint.html\" title=\"\"><em>Portnoy’s Complaint</em></a> and Burroughs’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/naked-lunch.html\" title=\"\"><em>Naked Lunch</em></a> persuaded me that to write fiction was to be obliged to take the reader by the hand to the edge – and jump. The business was to find a boundary, then cross it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"406c1d07fe40af822944bb99c18d838a66634992\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/27/1440691590607/1bd0066a-cad6-4755-acda-5853f38e747a-282x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The first edition jacket for First Love, Last Rites\" width=\"282\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first edition jacket.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If they came to court today, those novels of Joyce and Lawrence would certainly be allowed into the public domain without much trouble. But I’m not so sure what would happen in the courtrooms of Twitter. For now we live uneasily with our sexual freedom. Revelations of horrific and widespread child abuse have shocked us into uncertainty. Adults, especially men, have to be careful about speaking to children in the street. Feminists were right to tell us how oppressive public expressions of male desire could be. (If you doubt it, have another look at the excruciating, unfunny and embarrassing 1955 Marilyn Monroe movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048605/\" title=\"\"><em>The Seven Year Itch</em></a><em>.</em>) But desire, in women as in men, is a reality, a subject. Can’t we tell it from oppression? When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jun/03/craig-raine-poem-prompts-twitterstorm\" title=\"\">Craig Raine published in May this year a wistful, clever poem about an ageing man’s hopeless erotic thoughts</a>, it stirred rage, hatred and fantasies of violence, of vengeful genital mutilation across the social media. When a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jun/03/cover-jilly-cooper-novel-redesign-riders\" title=\"\">Jilly Cooper novel was reissued recently, the original cover of 30 years ago was altered to suit modern tastes</a> – a man’s hand was politely raised from a woman’s buttocks to her waist. Meanwhile, in books and especially on screens, sexual explicitness continues to flourish. Culturally, we are neither puritanical nor “liberated”. Just profoundly confused.</p> <p>The uses and abuses of freedom were the air we breathed in 1970. I feel neither nostalgic nor dismissive about those times now. There were gains and there were, plainly, excesses. When I showed my stories to Norwich friends, or to the two novelists who were keeping an avuncular eye on me, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/28/guardianobituaries.education\" title=\"\">Malcolm Bradbury</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/23/angus-wilson-darling-dodo\" title=\"\">Angus Wilson</a>, no one was shocked, no one thought my stories were outrageous or immoral. Bradbury would say something like: “Not bad. When can I see the next one?”</p> <p>By the mid-70s, the “60s” were winding down. The culture was waking up with a headache, and beginning to take stock. When it appeared in hardback, <em>First Love, Last Rites</em> was considered a critical, though certainly not a commercial, success. But even the positive reviews were scandalised. What monster had come among us? In fact, it was sometimes hard to tell the good reviews from the bad, for both listed with relish the obscenities and baroque perversions. It was difficult for me then, and would be even more difficult now, to persuade readers that my intentions were actually moral. My amoral first-person narrators especially were supposed to be condemning themselves out of their own mouths. I thought it was more interesting for the author not to intervene.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>As I read, I could smell tidal river mud from that high First Love, Last Rites summer of 1971</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before writing down these thoughts I took a copy of <em>First Love, Last Rites</em> from my shelves in order to read the title story. This copy once belonged to my parents, and has my dedication, dated 24 April 1975. (They were very proud, and a little horrified.) I don’t think I’d read the story since I corrected the proofs in late 1974. Once I was over my irritation with commas serving as full stops (a trick I must have learned from Beckett), I found myself looking across the span of my adult life – from 22 to almost 67.</p> <p>A pregnant rat scrabbling behind a skirting board was an invention, but the beautiful, self-contained teenage girl, her boisterous and charming younger brother, their family at a point of disintegration, the small fishing town and a doomed eel-catching business were all briefly part of my life. As I read, I could smell tidal river mud from that high <em>First Love, Last Rites</em> summer of 1971. The 45 years that had passed since I wrote the story shrank to nothing. It’s in the very nature of fiction that it lives suspended in a perpetual present tense. The past you think you’ve forgotten sits at your shoulder, waiting to remind you that life is indeed brief and you’d better make the best of what’s left.</p> <p>• The 40th anniversary edition of Ian McEwan’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/first-love-last-rites.html\" title=\"\"><em>First Love, Last Rites</em></a> is published by Vintage.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"In 1975, McEwan’s tales of sibling incest, cross-dressing and cat-roasting children in First Love, Last Rites scandalised critics.

Ten shelves of books soar up above us, from tomes on sexual practice in the ancient world to Fred Donner’s <em>Narratives of Islamic Origins</em>. Above his desk is a reproduction of a lovely 15th-century fresco of the young <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/10/why-cicero-campaign-strategists-mentor\">Cicero</a> reading, and laid here and there are reproduction military helmets (one, in the Roman style, elaborately plumed), a shield and a cricket bat. The last relates to Holland’s second obsession, aside from history: he is an ardent member of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/18/authors-xi-trundlers-cycling-ashes-review\">Authors XI</a>, and is much pained to have missed a recent match against the Thespian Thunderers.</p> <p>The new toy, which he fetches from a tiny vitrine occupied by pottery shards and other small treasures, is a gold coin minted in Rome, aglint with the unmistakably cherubic cheeks of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/apr/13/foodanddrink.features20\">emperor Nero</a>. “It’s rather an expensive hobby,” he says, a little guiltily. Nero is, perhaps, the most colourful character in his latest book, <em>Dynasty</em> – a thrilling account of the rise and fall of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/12/augustus-roman-emperors-great-dynasties\">Julio-Claudian dynasty</a>. It is in a sense the sequel to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview10\"><em>Rubicon</em></a>, his bestselling book on the collapse of the Roman republic published in 2003, a sequel long delayed by other projects – books on late antique and medieval history, an account of the Persian wars, and a translation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/03/herodotus-charlotte-higgins\">Herodotus</a>’s <em>Histories</em>.</p> <p><em>Dynasty</em> draws on the accounts of the period by Tacitus, Suetonius and others, and yet has a flavour all of its own: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/mar/10/art.heritage\">Augustus</a> is revealed as a sinister manipulator of the offices of the republic, his apparent refusal of honours a mere feint as he, in reality, heaped up more and more power for himself. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/roman-emperor-tiberius-2000-years\">Tiberius</a> is his melancholic foil, the man of principle who struggled to fit himself into the template created by Augustus. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/08/artsandhumanities.arts\">Caligula</a> is revealed not as a wild-eyed psychopath, as he was so brilliantly portrayed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/john-hurt\">John Hurt</a> in the TV adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/feb/24/tv-club-i-claudius\"><em>I, Claudius</em></a>, but as a cynic and sophisticate, who threatens to make his horse consul as a kind of cruel mockery of the recumbent senate. And Nero: he is the rococo culmination of them all, whose elaborate, brilliant self-creation as a figure of myth eventually causes the dynasty to collapse in on itself. Holland wrote the last section in a kind of fugue: “I’d wake up in the morning and think, ‘Oh my God! I have another day of writing about Nero.’ And I’d write about him and think about him all the time: he dominated my every waking moment. And I’d reach the end of the day and be too tired to continue, and instead of thinking, ‘Brilliant, I can stop now,’ I would think, ‘I wish I could carry on.’” One thing becomes abundantly clear: the story is sexually lurid, bloody and, at times, macabre. But the Julio-Claudians, in his account, were not mad. They were all, according to him, “remarkably able men”.</p> <p>Holland, 47, is tall, beaky, resplendently nerdy about history and fantastically quick-brained. Over the decade I have known him a little (the world of classics is small) he has also become steeled to a certain kind of battle. Last year, before the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence\">Scottish referendum</a>, he threw himself, with fellow historian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-snow\">Dan Snow</a>, into campaigning for the union, organising an open letter to Scottish voters by English celebrities from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tomdaley\">Tom Daley</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-attenborough\">David Attenborough</a>. Whether or not this lovebombing had any effect is moot: it certainly annoyed some, who felt patronised by the notion that their vote on a serious constitutional issue would be swayed by the views of, say, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/bobby-charlton\">Bobby Charlton</a>. More seriously, though, in 2012, a documentary he made for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4\">Channel 4</a> called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/28/the-untold-story-islam-accused\"><em>Islam: the Untold Story</em></a><em> </em>– based on his book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/in-shadow-of-sword-tom-holland\"><em>In the Shadow of the Sword</em></a> – provoked huge controversy. (The book itself was largely received very well.) The documentary looked at the origins of Islam from a strictly historical perspective, and expressed certain ideas – that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/islam\">Islam</a> may not have originated near Mecca, that there was a lack of Muslim historical evidence relating to the origins of the religion, and that little was known about the circumstances of the Qur’an’s composition – that sparked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/03/c4-islam-untold-story-complaints\">1,200 complaints</a> to Channel 4 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom\">Ofcom</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c91a6183309cc62d9428e016a64f22dec7aeda9b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/25/1440523409916/a4559ede-b837-457e-a6cc-0aeaae088576-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"New toy … Holland's gold Roman coin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New toy … Holland’s gold Roman coin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, Holland was immersed in the mother of all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter\">Twitter</a> storms. “Well, what I was really nervous about was less that someone would come and cut my head off than I would lose caste with fellow liberals – that people would think I was racist. So I went on Twitter to rebut accusations that I had got things wrong in the book, but also to square up to people saying, ‘You are doing this because you are racist.’ The problem with doing that meant that anyone could send me abusive comments or make threats against my family or me.” It must, I say, have been frightening and bleak for them (his wife, Sadie, is a midwife, and they have two daughters). “The experience of being in that storm – for a month or so, every day I would get a multitude of threats – was a bit like when you have a bruise on the lip. You feel that it’s enormous, and that everyone is looking at you. But if you look in the mirror, you can barely see it. No one really cares. In the eye of that storm, though, it is quite frightening.”</p> <p>Holland’s views on Islam, he says, were affected by the violent opinions he encountered online: “Certainly on Twitter there is a disturbing number of Muslims who do think apostates ought to be put to death, and you can see the effect of that in the Middle East, where Isis is not remiss in putting apostates to death. That’s the horror of it: one man’s apostate is another’s liberal Muslim.” I suggest that those who believe such things are in a tiny, tiny minority. Holland’s point, though, is that there are enough militants using the Qur’an as “the equivalent of a technical manual” for there to be real concern – and real value in applying historical methodologies to early Islamic history. He almost laughs at the surreal notion that late-antique history has become such an explosive force in modern politics and warfare – he recalls arguing about Sasanian law codes and their possible relationship with certain <em>hadiths</em> on Twitter – but of course we both know it is no laughing matter. The day after we speak the director of antiquities at Palmyra, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/19/khaled-al-asaad-profile-syria-isis-howard-carter-palmyra-archaeology\">Khaled al-Asaad</a>, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/18/isis-beheads-archaeologist-syria\">murdered by Isis</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>I’ve always felt the past contains more glamour than the present. I was obsessively into dinosaurs as a five-year-old</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Holland thinks historical inquiry into early Islam can, in the long term, play a part in neutralising violent fundamentalist groups such as Isis – a position he laid out in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/christopher-hitchens\">Christopher Hitchens</a> lecture this summer at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/guardian-hay-festival\">Hay festival</a>. While I salute Holland’s aims as a historian – surely nothing should be out of bounds as a field of historical inquiry – I am, I admit, less certain of this notion. We briefly argue about whether the movement to historicise the events recounted in the Bible in the 19th century actually had much effect on people’s faith, which to my mind is governed by factors beyond the rational. And the radicalisation of a minority of Muslims surely cannot be separated from the effects of western foreign policy. Christian fundamentalism, by way of comparison, furthermore seems to me to be a postmodern phenomenon, not something that was tempered by 19th-century rational historical inquiry. He disagrees: the work of scholars such as Albert Schweitzer “changed the terms of argument in the west: Christians do not take the Old Testament as literally as they did 200 years ago and even creationists accept that evolution is a challenge they have to answer.” He becomes animated: “To be honest, I wouldn’t care about any of these things were it not for the fact that people are using these [religious] texts to justify the raping of nine-year-old girls.” He is referring here to the appalling acts visited on, particularly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/13/father-of-the-brave-the-yazidi-christian-who-rescues-hostages-from-isis\">Yazidi</a> girls and women by Isis. “To me, if you think that raping nine-year-old girls is wrong, it’s wrong not to point out that the traditions concerning Muhammad might have a contributory factor to play. It’s not to say that that is all they mean, or that’s the only interpretation that can be placed on them, because to do so would be to be as fundamentalist as the most diehard Isis fighter. But to pretend it is not an issue at all seems disingenuous.”</p> <p>In fact all this is to put the cart before the horse: Isis had yet to emerge when Holland started work on <em>In the Shadow of the Sword</em>, and his interest in the origins of Islam stemmed not from modern politics and religion but from a desire to investigate how the Arab Muslim empire had emerged from the collapse of two ancient empires, the Roman and the Persian. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/04/history.tomholland\"><em>Millennium</em></a>, his 2008 book, had looked at the distinctive culture that had emerged from the rubble of the Roman empire in western Europe. “The sense was that the Franks and the Goths and the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths were as Roman as they were barbarian – and that seemed a very interesting template for early Islam. You only have to look at [Jerusalem’s] Dome of the Rock to see that it is very Roman. I wanted to know the extent to which the paradigms that govern the understanding of how the empire in the west fell apply to the east.”</p> <p>He adds: “I think in a sense you’re engaging in <em>trahison des clercs</em> if you think paradigms you are happy to apply to any other period of history should not be applied to this one. We are happy to study the way religion and empire relate in every other era. Are we really saying that this is the one period in which we should not be doing this? Because that, in a sense, seems the really Islamophobic thing to do.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/05/dinomania-dinosaur-obsession-science\">Dinomania: the story of our obsession with dinosaurs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Holland grew up in Wiltshire, near <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/stonehenge\">Stonehenge</a> and Wilton, whose origins go back to Anglo-Saxon Wessex. (His next book, aside from a translation of Suetonius’s <em>The 12 Caesars</em>, is a study of the 10th-century king Athelstan for the Penguin Monarchs series, a project bound up with childhood memories that he calls an “emotional core of magma waiting to be expressed”.) There wasn’t much to do except read, he says. His younger brother James, a historian of the second world war, was doubtless at it, too. “I have always felt that the past contains more glamour, colour and excitement than the present. I was neurotically, obsessively into dinosaurs as a five-year-old. And prehistory generally. The whole sweep. What moved and excited me was the sense of empires rising and falling: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2014/dec/28/top-10-dinosaur-facts-jonathan-tennant\">Palaeozoic</a>, the Mesozoic, the Cenozoic. Then I was given, all at roughly the same time: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/asterix\"><em>Asterix</em></a>; a book about the Roman army with a picture on the cover of a centurion with a Gallic spear in his stomach; and a book about Greek myths. I was moved and excited by them in exactly the same way as I was by looking at pictures of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/12/firstchapters.extract2\">trilobites</a> or the asteroid hitting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/21/mass-extinction-science-warning\">cretaceous biospheres</a>.”</p> <p>He became very interested in the Persian wars, and, at 12, took out a translation of Herodotus from the library. “It was the first classic of any kind I read.” What he hadn’t realised is that before you get to the battles of Marathon and Thermopylae you have to plough through endless “shaggy-dog stuff” including various chunks of Lydian and Persian history, and a lengthy account of the habits of the Egyptians. Gradually, though, he fell in love with Herodotus. “Over the course of my writing career I have done the <em>Histories</em> as a Radio 4 <em>Book at Bedtime</em>, as a BBC radio drama, I used him as a source in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview4\"><em>Persian Fire</em></a>, and then I had the privilege of being asked to translate him. It’s an amazing intimacy with a writer – it’s like a marriage. You will never be closer to a writer than when you are translating him.” Astonishingly, Holland is completely self-taught in Greek. He set himself the task of tackling a chunk a day, seven days a week, and the experience now, he says, acts as a kind of memory diary: when he reads any given part of the <em>Histories</em> he can call to mind when and where he was when he translated it. When he finished, his children garlanded the small bust of Herodotus that sits in his study and made him a Greek feast in celebration. Delight was mixed with melancholy. “I thought: ‘It’s all over, and I will never have that closeness again.’”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2013/nov/04/howard-carter-tutankhamun-photography\">Howard Carter and Tutankhamun - a picture from the past</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite his love of ancient history Holland studied English at Cambridge. He had found “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\">Dickens</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/shakespeare\">Shakespeare</a> and poetry compulsively wonderful in the way I had found ancient history and dinosaurs wonderful”. He now thinks that “subliminally I was worried that doing a degree in ancient history or classics would somehow let the light in on it”. But in a way it made perfect sense: it was the literary quality of history that he adored, especially “the mythopoetic quality of history” that drenches ancient texts. He began a PhD on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/lordbyron\">Byron</a> and ancient Greece “and rapidly realised that everything that was most interesting about Byron was that he was a great popular hero who invented the cult of celebrity. So I thought a way of paying tribute to that would be to write a novel in which he is a vampire.” The book (<em>The Vampyre</em>, 1995) did well enough, and he was contracted into writing another three, “which had never been a part of my life plan”. He says: “The last one was set in Egypt and it was like a Russian doll, so the outer structure was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2013/nov/04/howard-carter-tutankhamun-photography\">Howard Carter discovering Tutankhamun’s tomb</a>, inside it was Al-Hakim, the Muslim Caligula of the 11th century, and the inner core was the story of Akhenaten and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jun/12/thisweekssciencequestions1\">Nefertiti</a>, who were probably the parents of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tutankhamun\">Tutankhamun</a>. And I just did an incredible amount of research for it. There was almost nothing I didn’t know about the career of Carter or Fatimid Cairo or the 18th dynasty. I thought: people are going to love all this research I have put into it. But because it was a vampire book, nobody gave a toss.” So he went back to what he had loved as a teenager. He says – using a rather striking, and I think unconscious, vampiric image: “I had sucked every book dry that I could on the Roman republic when I was a young and I thought: ‘That’s what I want to write about now.’” And so he started on <em>Rubicon</em> and the rest is, in every sense, history. There is a great deal of desire in Holland’s inner world. He tells me of writing <em>Dynasty</em>: “When I was writing it the process was charged with a kind of excitement and passion and joy – the same kind of passion and joy I can imagine a poet channelling when writing about love.” It shows.</p> <p>• To order <em>Dynasty</em> for £20 (RRP £25) go to <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/323351/\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

awakening: three essential rules for writing good sex","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-08-28T08:51:13Z","fields":{"wordcount":"972","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4bpzj","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>There is only one thing I loathe more than badly-written sex scenes, and that is when they are brief or omitted altogether. At least the bad ones are amusing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>When his hand brushed her nipple it tripped a switch and she came alight. He touched her belly and his hand seemed to burn through her. He lavished on her body indirect touches and bitter-sweet sensations flooded her brain.”<br /></em>(The Age of Magic by Ben Okri, winner of the Bad sex in fiction award 2014)<em><br /></em></p> </blockquote> <p> I’ve always believed that the physical side of love is more than a bit of fun – both in life and in fiction. It is a non-verbal dance that will take you on as extraordinary a journey as you are willing to embark on. Once in a writing group I read out an (admittedly longish) description of a kiss and one of the men said, “Oh come on it’s just a kiss!” The five women in the group booed him loudly in protest. </p> <p> When I started to write my novel <a href=\"http://www.kimdevereux.co.uk/Rembrandts_Mirror/Rembrandts_Mirror.html\">Rembrandt’s Mirror</a> I realised that love and sexuality were at the heart of the story of the 17th-century Dutch master and 21-year-old <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/rembrandt-portrait-of-hendrickje-stoffels\">Hendrickje Stoffels</a>, who came to work for him as a maid. It is the journey of Hendrickje’s sexual awakening at a time when a woman was either wife, virgin or whore. She had to find a way to become something of her own making. As for Rembrandt, he was still oppressed by grief and guilt after the death of his wife Saskia, unable or unwilling to love again. </p> <p>So I set out to do love justice and avoid winning the Bad sex in fiction award. In the process I have assembled a handy list of dos and don’ts.<br /></p> <h2><strong>Don’t be coy, call a spade a spade</strong></h2> <p>But don’t call a penis a “penis”. At least not if you are writing a historical novel. “Manhood” won’t do either. It’s too archaic. And don’t ridicule your leading man by calling his wang a <a href=\"https://airjordang.wordpress.com/2014/04/06/list-monday-yiddish-words-for-penis/\">petzel </a>– not in a heartfelt moment anyway. Avoid calling it something obvious like cock if it is not a term he would have favoured. Show some respect and opt for something like “staff” – but only if you don’t mind sounding pompous. Or you could go for “rod”, though it’s a bit Mills and Boon. But under no circumstances let him hear you refer to it as “Tiny Tim”.</p> <p>If you’re stuck for more suggestions, don’t go for online lists of funny synonyms as you will only find yourself confronted with “womb broom” or “Prince Everhard of the Netherlands”.</p> <p>Do go for the etymological dictionary for epithets that feel historical: like, membrum virile, arbor vitae (from the late 18th century, for a type of evergreen shrub), wrinkly (early 15th century) or bole (early 14th century, from Old Norse bolr meaning tree trunk).</p> <p>My own solution was to let Hendrickje name it and she called it: “A riddle in my hand.”</p> <h2><strong>Do describe some truly disappointing sex</strong></h2> <p>Nothing makes your novel feel more true to life than having some not-so-great love-making in it. Let’s face it, sex sometimes goes wrong even between the greatest of lovers. Here is a scene between Lady Chatterley and Mellors:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>And when he came in to her, with an intensification of relief and consummation that was pure peace to him, still she was waiting. She felt herself a little left out. And she knew, partly it was her own fault. She willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to it. She lay still, feeling his motion within her, his deep-sunk intentness, the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed, then the slow subsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks, surely it was a little ridiculous! If you were a woman, and apart in all the business, surely that thrusting of the man’s buttocks was supremely ridiculous.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Don’t use cliches (avoid waves, oceans and the earth moving)</strong></h2> <p>Here’s the problem; a writer mustn’t tell the reader that the lovers are feeling “excited”, or “ensconced in one another” or – heaven forbid – “passionate”. It works much better to approach the task obliquely by seeking inspiration (and terminology) from another field.</p> <p>I wrote most of my love scenes after dancing tango, which after all has been called “a vertical expression of a horizontal desire”. The excerpt that follows is an example (embellished just a little). I confess I broke the avoid-anything-oceanic rule but I think I got away with it as I use it to describe the way she experiences sensations, rather than the sensations themselves.<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>His arms opened and we embraced. We stood like this for a lifetime. </em><em>I held him in his maturity, as a baby and as a dying man. I sank </em><em>deeper into his chest as if into Mother Earth herself. I felt his care for </em><em>me as I grew younger, and younger still, until I was a newborn and </em><em>then nothing at all.</em></p> <p><em>“This nothing-me felt the touch of his lips. Felt them but not the </em><em>way I’d felt them before, more like the ocean holds the fish that </em><em>swim in it. I was each wavelet and the stillness at the bottom where </em><em>no current stirs. His hands worked slowly to free my body from its </em><em>clothes. I felt sleeves slide down my arms and skirts fall from my </em><em>waist – the warmth from the stove enveloping my skin.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>But don’t take inspiration from inappropriate activities such as DIY, gardening or watching the home shopping channel. It will only cause you to write about him threading his wrinkly through her arboretum as if he was her tailor and groundsman in one.</p> <p>• Kim Devereux’s novel Rembrandt’s Mirror is published by Atlantic at £12.99 and is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/318322/\">available from the Guardian bookshop at £10.39.</a></p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Serious fiction should not ignore physical love, but it’s hard to get right.

Book, it’s not dangerous anymore.

I was a white, sheltered, male suburban teen given two fully loaded barrels of feminism, racial history, slavery, tenderness, the beauty of sexuality, and (incidentally) formal experimentation. Aged 14, pre-internet, I won’t pretend I understood everything, but the world of reading was suddenly so much bigger, suddenly so much more intriguingly, properly dangerous, that I was never the same again.

It contains appalling, appealing naughtiness and deep, deep magic. Every word is delicious and powerful. I was scared by it when I was small, but that was part of the attraction. I got lost in its pages and practiced and practiced my unblinking stare, just in case. The book was banned in some American states because it wasn’t fluffy or cute. Child psychologist Bruno Bettleheim said that the book was psychologically damaging because a mother sending a child to bed without food was abusive. And in the UK that ‘banned’ aura wafted from every page. I was well aware that this book was dangerous. But it’s clear Mr Bettleheim never actually read Where the Wild Things Are because when Max comes home his supper is waiting for him. And it’s still hot. For a wonderful, weird, wild book, it’s really very comforting.</p> <h2><strong><br /></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ab6c0340a6631e1d25a0470204fd5ab8b86b7110\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440585332410/144ae0d4-6fbe-444e-ae32-3cbcc05162ad-311x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" width=\"311\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Terry Deary, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/who-s-horrible-in-history.html\">Horrible Histories</a> including latest <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/280771/\">Top 50 Kings and Queens</a> </strong></h2> <p>I’m going for <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-15.html\">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a> by Roald Dahl (published 1964) because If Roald Dahl hadn’t made black humour acceptable on the bookshelves of children’s fiction then I could never have published Horrible Histories. Before Charlie and the Chocolate Factory hardly anyone died in a children’s book (except the spider in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/charlotte-s-web-8.html\">Charlotte’s Web</a>, 1952.) Children’s naughtiness was of the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/317461/\">Just William</a> level of scrumping and truanting, while adult characters were often the villains and retribution on them was never violent. But Dahl had his wicked children punished by drowning in chocolate, inflating into a giant blueberry, thrown down a garbage chute and being shrunk to a couple of inches. No wonder many publishers rejected it. It was eventually accepted but many reviewers and children’s authors lambasted it as “nauseating fantasy” or “astonishingly insensitive”, while others said books should not be aimed at both children and adults … how times have changed. But young readers loved it. Dahl had blazed a giant trail that the rest of us dwarves can only follow, gratefully and humbly.’</p> <h2><strong><br /></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b3d75202e8352f5fb70f32eb21af75dad38376c1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440585624785/1c63e704-d4c1-49da-bf94-8203afc5330f-258x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Lolita\" width=\"258\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Dawn Kurtagich – author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/317740/\">The Dead House</a></strong><br /></h2> <p>My dangerous book pick is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/lolita-6.html\">Lolita</a> by Vladimir Nabokov. Shortly after it’s publication in the UK in 1959, the Minister of the Interior banned the book, because it was called “filth” and “pornography”. The ban lasted for two years.Lolita tells the story of the “romancing” of a 12 year-old young girl, told from the perspective of the 37-year-old Humbert Humbert. This novel taught me many things—the most important of them being that unreliable narrators exist! I had no conception of such a thing before this novel came into my life. Imagine discovering that the narrator whom you have come to rely on for the truth of a story has been an unreliable source the whole time! I learned that one man’s perspective might seem completely honourable to him, but that his truth may not be the core truth of a tale. What an amazing lesson to learn, and I am very lucky to have learned it from such a masterpiece.</p> <h2><strong><br /></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e0cc399dd189bd6d53cd955a40044c07b3bd0917\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440585827124/8fe84e18-1110-454e-9aa2-cb3546ffe77e-269x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The Book Thief\" width=\"269\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Liz Kessler, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285177/\">Read Me Like a Book</a></strong><br /></h2> <p>My favourite dangerous book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/book-thief-3.html\">The Book Thief</a>, by Marcus Zusak. Take Nazi Germany, book burnings in the street, hidden Jews in your cellar, a girl pitted against Hitler himself, and then throw in God as your narrator - and you’ve got yourself a dangerous book.

Our society is such a vigorous beast, it swallows ideas whole and makes them its own in one gulp. It’s a lot of fun when people get upset about books, but it’s all thunder and no lightning strikes.

Originally published as anthropology (something that has been much questioned since) it’s the the story of a young man’s apprenticeship with a Yaqui “Man of Knowledge.” There’s all sorts of spiritual and magical practices, and a lot of hallucinogenic drugs involved. It’s a fascinating book, still. Looking back, some it seems to be rubbish, but a lot of it is still mysterious and wonderful and still attracts me - not so much in the magic, but in the ideas underneath. And yes, it could be dangerous, partly because it refuses to talk about what is true and what is not true. But - and all those hallucinogenic drugs! Not something to undertake lightly. The idea still frightens the pants off me.</p> <h2><strong><br /></strong></h2> <h2><strong>Nicky Singer, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/feather-boy.html\">Feather Boy</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2d4ea55ccc1b682852549705b92ceb9c102616e3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440586271994/714ceeba-02cb-4e0d-af2f-4462d3816287-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Venus In Furs\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Our house was full of books and nobody restricted (or indeed directed…) my reading. One day, aged about 12, I selected <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/venus-in-furs.html\">Venus in Furs</a> by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. I have a very vivid recollection of the cover which may – or may not – be accurate; a soft pink background, a women’s body enveloped in furs. No head to the body. No face. The book is, of course, a highly charged tale of sexual slavery and degradation by the man who gave his name to masochism. I found it suitably exciting – and read it more than once. I don’t believe I was sexually damaged/awakened or shaped by the experience. I remember the feeling of frisson when reading – but no shame or guilt. I’m not sure I would have suggested the book to my own daughter at that age, but then I think there is a huge difference between ‘suggesting’ and ‘finding’ such a book. It does make me think that while there are often dark themes in YA fiction, 12 years olds are highly protected these days. Maybe we should trust our young people more… </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fa49f6593158c2f8eb48330d9d59f1e801130573\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440586642069/e0326617-74af-4486-960d-e814535736a3-267x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The Bell Jar\" width=\"267\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sita Brahmachari, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/artichoke-hearts.html\">Artichoke Hearts</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/kite-spirit.html\">Kite Spirit</a></strong></h2> <p>I’m going for<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bell-jar-4.html\"> The Bell Jar </a>By Sylvia Plath. I considered it dangerous because I was told by the librarian that it was too tragic and depressing for someone my age . I was then fifteen and thought I should be able to read anything. So naturally in the great tradition of when an adult does tell you not to read something it becomes strangely more compelling. Actually I should have listened. I found it profoundly upsetting to see this woman in a hopeless mental decline but also to know that the author had taken her own life. I also remember having a dream after reading it in which I imagined someone from Plath’s family coming to find me and telling me that “The story is private” and “You have not right intrude”.</p> <p>It’s how I felt as I read it, perhaps this is because of the autobiographical quality. I did enjoy reading it because of of the rites of passage story of a young woman making her way in the world. It also later led me to Plath’s and Ted Hughes poetry which I became rather obsessed with at University. I think I was caught up in the intersection between a fictional and real life story and found that fascinating but also dangerous to play out those relationships in fiction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e35241f8ab6db26747f267f1fac933dd5e8dc220\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440586950028/2c3cd729-813b-48de-bf4f-669264c940b4-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Dracula\" width=\"273\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Natasha Farrant, author of the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/after-iris.html\">Bluebell Gadsby Diaries</a>. </strong></h2> <p>My dangerous book was Bram Stoker’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dracula-47.html\">Dracula</a>. I don’t know what possessed me to read it. I had seen an old film of Dracula at the age of 13, which had my cousin and little sister in stitches of laughter, and me cowering behind the sofa. Well into my twenties, I couldn’t sleep unless the sheets or duvet were pulled over my head, making my neck inaccessible to vampire fangs. I used to sleep with garlic in my bedroom and say the Hail Mary every night. I think I read the book to exorcise the demon of the film, but it only made things worse. I had to hide it in a drawer when I wasn’t reading it, in another room, wrapped in blankets so the evil Count couldn’t crawl out and get me. I was actually afraid of the book as a physical object.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"204a222efc3865503281a05e41447a18072bc95d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440587058599/f2d264e2-2937-499d-96cc-8d5798f28d5d-274x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Go Ask Alice\" width=\"274\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jenny Valentine, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/finding-violet-park.html\">Finding Violet Park</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/308353/\">Fire Colour One</a></strong></h2> <p>The most dangerous book I read (when I was about 13) was probably <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/go-ask-alice.html\">Go Ask Alice</a>. At the time, it was sold as a non fiction book, the diary of a real (middle class, white, American, teenage) girl slipping from her normal happy life into an underworld of drugs and sex and misery. I still have my 1980 corgi edition. Go Ask Alice by Anonymous, all bleeding hearts and shocking truths and primary evidence. I remember finding it powerful and moving at the time, especially because three weeks after the last diary entry, anonymous was found dead by her parents. That’s not why the book was dangerous. It was dangerous because it was basically a lie. Written by a psychologist called Beatrice Sparks, (apparently based on the diaries of a patient but those were never produced) it reads now like a heavy handed, conformist, alarmist tract. Dressed up as the authentic voice of teenage anguish, it’s really just a judgemental cautionary tale. And a manipulative one at that. I wonder if it did more harm than good, although not oto Ms Sparks and her publishers. It was a bestseller for close to a decade. As a 13-year[old I was taken in by it. I’m not sure how many people would be now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f139e652f2e75cef402eee81a735906be88fad67\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440587207305/b07d79ac-be40-414f-9b7d-b2aa8e489bf3-273x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Creed\" width=\"273\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>James Dawson, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/this-book-is-gay.html\">This Book Is Gay</a> and most lately <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/329278/\">All Of The Above</a></strong></h2> <p>I would say James Herbert’s ‘<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/creed.html\">Creed</a>’ which I read when I was about 12. It’s scary, surreal and hugely sexually explicit. I really had no business reading it, to be honest, and that’s why I always defend young adult fiction - some people might say it’s dark or subversive even, but it’s always within the realm of exploration, experimentation and testing boundaries. That said, reading Creed “never did me any harm” and, looking back, was perfectly natural curiosity, which I think is something to be encouraged.</p> <h2><strong>Candy Gourlay, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/shine-259001.html\">Shine</a></strong></h2> <p>When I was growing up in the Philippines, there were very few locally published books for children and so everything I read was imported from America and the United Kingdom. When I think back, ALL the books I read as a child were dangerous. They took me out of the ordered rules of my cultural life and proposed that there were other choices out there.</p> <p>I explored worlds that bore no resemblance to my own in my native Philippines. They made me disgruntled, discontented with my lot. Western characters seemed to travel everywhere, and as a little girl in Manila, I could not imagine ever being wealthy enough to even travel to any of the nearby countries in Southeast Asia. I puzzled over how characters spoke their minds. In my ordinary world, there were complex, unwritten ways of communicating, saying yes even if you mean no is an art embedded in many Asian cultures.<br /></p> <p>It was not just culture clash either. Here were child characters who had eye-popping adventures, who ignored boundaries, who took their fates in their own hands. It was terrifying and unimaginable. And oh so delicious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5cc88606dbc44013c861ad935b5ee531a516a2fc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440587307369/f2d9a478-be2f-435c-ad4a-b392d1872883-273x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Day of the Jackal\" width=\"273\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Piers Torday, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/last-wild.html\">The Last Wild</a> trilogy</strong></h2> <p>I remember very clearly reading <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/day-of-the-jackal.html\">Day of the Jackal</a> by Frederick Forsyth when I was around 10, probably plucking it at random from a stuffed bookshelf in a house we were renting on holiday, and devouring it immediately. I don’t think my parents were that outraged, but I was! It’s a fast paced violent thriller about an attempt to assassinate a French president, Charles de Gaulle, and is part based on a real life hitman called Carlos the Jackal. But it opened my eyes to so much. I was shocked by scenes where policemen, who I had always thought of as the good guys, colluded with corrupt criminals or worse. The French secret services, who I presumed to be heroes like our James Bond, kidnap and torture people in the name of the national interest. Nice and innocent people get killed, sometimes brutally. There is sexual violence. The book has been filmed twice, and by today’s standards, might seem quaint to many. But when I remember my alarm, shock, dismay and total visceral thrill at discovering the many certainties I took for granted - like trusting all security forces without question - I’m reminded of powerful effect books written for different ages can have on their unintended readers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4c689567e66f17b59bf97fa58e082ffe5ef53c9f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440587425199/773491c5-501d-4439-b804-f9c1bf8ffdd2-273x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The Autobiography of Malcom X\" width=\"273\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Bali Rai, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/un-arranged-marriage.html\">(Un)arranged marriage</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/web-of-darkness.html\">Web of Darkness</a></strong></h2> <p>The first book I’d classify as dangerous would be <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/autobiography-of-malcolm-x-2.html\">The Autobiography of Malcolm X</a> (with Alex Haley). It’s a book that changed the way I thought about politics, and the power relationships that define modern societies in the West. It’s a challenging and brutally honest book. I was twenty-one years old when I read it, and it made so much sense - especially at a time when Stephen Lawrence’s murder was still very recent. The book made me angry, and it made me determined to write about big themes in Life. But it also gave me hope. Malcolm X’s early life was blighted by poverty, crime, racism and drug addiction, yet he managed to overcome those challenges and better him own life, and the lives of countless others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"80d201f710dfcb2be6aa4267880001d08fe28a61\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440587572270/7827d8f9-31d2-4311-8420-6a0701468b7b-252x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Yardie\" width=\"252\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At the same time, I was reading Yardie by Victor Headly - an amazingly visceral and accurate story about a Jamaican drug dealer in London. I’d always wanted to write books about real lives, on real streets, and much of literature felt stale and boring. Yardie was a massive punch in the face by comparison. Most mainstream reviewers slaughtered the book at review - and the writing isn’t exactly Booker Prize level - but Yardie was never meant to be part of the mainstream, or classically literary. It stuck two fingers up at traditional ideas about literature, and would have had most old-school English professors and reviewers pulling their hair out. For that reason alone, it was fresh and dangerous, and utterly brilliant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"360700308c0c1571ddddd5baba54f6304ac53755\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440592075246/847a7338-0684-4592-bb97-6aacf4461482-275x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The Collector\" width=\"275\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Rae Earl, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/my-mad-fat-diary.html\">My Mad Fat Diary</a></strong></h2> <p>I knew some books were dangerous when my mum ripped up, in a brilliantly flamboyant way, a slice of prime pulp about the Hells Angels that my brother had. In fact he had loads of books I wasn’t meant to read like Jerry Ahern’s ‘The Survivalist’ series (guns, nuclear war, cannibals).</p> <p>Horror didn’t appeal to me though. My Mum however had some corkers that probably to this day she doesn’t know I read really early on. The one that really stands out is John Fowles ‘<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/collector.html\">The Collector</a>’. At about age 11 I was WAY too young for it but it gripped me. As someone brought up on a heady diet of public information films about ‘Stranger Danger’ and goodies and baddies it turned everything I knew turn on its head. It plays with the reader like no book I’ve read before or since. And that ending? My head was wonderfully messed up for years.

The world of squatting, addiction, and anarchy in the novel was as far removed as could be from my own childhood in a small town in the wilds of west Cork. That book shook me to my very core; it made me see how easily young people could fall through the cracks of our society if not protected.

It was the start of my love for magical realism, and as a victim of sexual assault, it was the story I didn’t know I needed until it came to life in my hands. I saw myself in Pauline, the weak-willed narrator who doesn’t know what to make of dangerous, confident Fleur. But I wanted to see myself in Fleur: a woman who survives violence and is in no way humbled by it—who is, in fact, a violent, vengeful force of her own. It was probably a story meant for older readers, but it found its way to me at just the right time.</p> <h2><strong>Dav Pilkey, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/adventures-of-captain-underpants.html\">Captain Underpants</a></strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/adventures-of-huckleberry-finn-17.html\">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a> by Mark Twain was banned in my school because of the language.

But I’m sure if I had, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/29/can-you-top-rl-stines-terrifying-twitter-tale-halloween\">RL Stine</a> in particular I would have pictured a man in an attic somewhere, isolated and gnarled and cutting newspaper clippings about killers for leaning towers of scrapbooks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jun/30/darren-shan-horror-books-for-teens-demonata\">Why you can't behead the protagonist's mother when writing horror for teens</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Yet the voice on the phone when I called Stine this week to chat about his new book for even smaller children – The Little Shop of Monsters, a collaboration with Arthur creator Marc Brown – is mild as midwestern cheddar. “I’m a grandpa,” he says by way of explaining this latest of his projects, which he wrote for his 18-month-old grandson. “He enjoyed it,” Stine says proudly.</p> <p>He can’t stop praising his co-author Brown, who Stine credits with the idea for the book. “I said, ‘you have such a good reputation, why would you want to do a book with me?’” Stine says, before going on to rhapsodize about the illustrations Brown drew for the book, drafting the first of them directly on to the manuscript. “I think all the time,” he adds, with the unmistakable tone of a man who knows how to tell a dad joke, “that Mark had this inner monster.”</p> <p>In fact, Stine starts to seem so unrelentingly nice, so utterly gentle, that a cynic might think it’s an act. I mention that Jack Black, who will play Stine in a film adaptation of his mega-selling Goosebumps series this fall, had said that he found Stine not very scary in person and if anything too nice. Stine laughs: “My whole life that’s been my problem.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cn716jv61s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Cn716jv61s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Fright night: Goosebumps</figcaption> </figure>   <p>His books became ubiquitous – at certain points in his career his books sold 4 million copies a month – and because of that success many people associate Stine only with the light, always-resolved-in-time-for-bed horror of the Goosebumps books, Point Horror and the Fear Street series. But in fact, when he came to New York from Columbus, Ohio, he really wanted to be a humorist. He had spent his childhood immersed in comics, reading the work of Ray Bradbury, Asimov, Ray Sheckley and watching the Twilight Zone.</p> <p>But his real dream as a young man, he says, was to have a humor magazine of his own like the storied Mad Magazine. At 28, he achieved this goal when he became the editor of Bananas, a magazine <a href=\"http://glorymiller.hubpages.com/hub/Bananas-Magazine\">scholastic once distributed in schools</a>. “When the magazine ended ten years later, I figured I’d coast the rest of my life,” he said. He wrote a lot of humor books but few sold (“I wrote for 20 years before anyone noticed I was around”).</p> <p>One fateful day in the mid-80s changed his life. “It was the point in my career where I would say yes to anything,” he says. And he went to lunch with a scholastic editor who told him she needed a teen horror novel written. </p> <p>“It’s an embarassing story,” he says, “because it wasn’t even my idea.” She gave him a title – Blind Date – and told him to go home and write it. He did and it became a bestseller – in Stine’s account – without the least bit of marketing to go along with it. “No one really knew me, and there was no hype, and there was no advertising for it,” he said. “It was just kids telling kids. It was a secret kids network.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>He writes in a room with a human skeleton, a dummy of himself, and a three-foot fake cockroach</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was the beginning of a kind of industry. Stine’s sales are still very high. Goosebumps sales, in particular, were in the stratosphere in their heyday, in the tens of millions, before a slump hit in 1997. Stine became a highly disciplined machine – he still writes about six days a week, trying to crank out about two thousand words a day. His favourite place to write is in his Manhattan apartment, in a room that contains, he tells me, a human skeleton, a dummy of himself, and a three-foot fake cockroach. His wife, Jane Waldhorn, edits his work. (“Can you imagine being married to your editor?” Stine asked me. “Nothing gets by her!”) </p> <p>Returning to Stine’s books as an adult, it is a bit hard to say exactly what it was that sucked me in so completely as an adolescent. The plots are pretty simple; children encounter something they don’t understand, and without the least bit of help from any parents manage to get themselves back out of the jam again. I asked Stine why he thought. “They tell me they like to be scared,” he said simply. But he recognizes that the scare has to be contained, cushioned, in order to retain such broad appeal. “We know we’re having this horrifying adventure,” Stine said of the appeal of horror more generally, “but we [also] know we’re safe.”</p> <p>He learned this from personal experience when he once wrote a Fear Street book with an unhappy ending. “I wrote it just for fun, for me,” he says of this time he strayed from the formula. After the book was published, Stine was inundated with angry letters from fans demanding that he resolve the ending. “They turned on me immediately,” he said, “And I got all this mail. ‘Dear RL Stine, you moron. How could you do that?’” He eventually wrote a sequel to answer the complaints.</p> <p>He has had critics in other quarters too. In the 1990s, his books frequently generated controversy in school libraries; parents often tried to ban them. It all seems rather tempest-in-a-teapot to think about now, given that the content of Goosebumps and Fear Street is not nearly as dark as that of, say, Twilight, let alone the “creepypasta” memes that float around the internet. “There were a lot fewer protests that I’d imagined,” Stine said, actually. “But no one had ever done horror for kids.”</p> <p>And over time it’s been clear that really the only lasting effect of his books is a lingering warmth towards the author. When I confessed to Stine I’d been one of his more voracious readers, he said: “And you didn’t turn out too twisted, right?”</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Millions grew up with his stories and Jack Black plays him in an adaptation of his bestselling series.

However, it was not published until 13 years after Peterloo and its most striking impact came almost a century later, in the New York protest marches led by Pauline Newman. The timeline for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\">Labour’s current leadership election</a> is rather tighter in comparison.</p> <p>Publishing <em>Poets for Corbyn</em> was never intended as hagiography in rhyme, but rather as a collection of poems celebrating and supporting our chance to reaffirm Labour’s historical values. On Corbyn’s nomination, I invited some of my favourite left-leaning poets to contribute. A few of the more hard-line turned down the offer, seeing little hope in parliamentary democracy. But Michael Schmidt, general editor of PN Review and one of the contributors, put me in touch with a number of enthusiastic Corbynites. <a href=\"https://newbootsandpantisocracies.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/day-one-hundred-w-n-herbert-andy-jackson/\">WN Herbert</a> and Andy Jackson’s <a href=\"https://newbootsandpantisocracies.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/day-one-hundred-w-n-herbert-andy-jackson/\"><em>New Boots and Pantisocracies</em></a> was an invaluable source, alongside <a href=\"http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/tf23bff-well%20versed\">Jody Porter’s Well Versed</a> series in the Morning Star.</p> <p>The book, featuring 20 writers including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/michael-rosen\">Michael Rosen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/29/poem-of-the-week-caracal-by-pascale-petit\">Pascale Petit</a>, Nicholas Murray and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/08/constellations-ian-pindar-review\">Ian Pindar</a>, opens with Tom Pickard’s caustic assessment of austerity Britain. I felt this reflected where much of the support for Corbyn’s leadership run stems from: not only a hatred of Tory attacks on the poor, but also a growing dismay with a Labour party acquiescent to the prevailing neoliberal narrative. Through a mixture of new and republished poems, the rest of the book attempts to strike a balance between enthusiasm for Corbyn and more general calls for a return to humane politics. Allegory is, of course, a powerful tool for the political poet as evidenced in the macaws, lobsters and dolls that populate the book. Here poetry has a real advantage over potentially hectoring op-eds.</p> <p>As is clear to the reader, many of the poets harbour a strong anti-Blair sentiment. Ian Birchall serves a warning to (Blairite) Labour politicians of a career ending in the House of Lords “Sans teeth, sans brain, sans guts, sans principles”. Nick Telfer continues the theme, editing out an obscenity from his poem pleading for “NO BLAIR”. We couldn’t get much further from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2014/jun/09/david-cameron-cool-britannia-bash-invitation\">Cool Britannia</a>, that unbecoming moment when celebrities and artists embraced George W Bush’s pal.</p> <p>Erin Belieu’s darkly comic “Poem of Philosophical and Parental Conundrums Written In An Election Year” closes the book. Belieu, a Hilary Clinton supporting American, transforms the political into the personal with her look at divorce and parenthood. It’s well-known that Corbyn divorced his second wife following a dispute over where to send their son to school. Indeed, an alternative title considered for <em>Poets for Corbyn</em> was <em>A Comprehensive Divorce</em>. Corbyn’s followers, analogously, are hoping for a comprehensive divorce with New Labour ideology.Reaction to it has ranged from the mocking to the well considered. Patrick Kidd, cricket writer and diarist, called it “ear-bleedingly awful” in the Times. Howzat for an endorsement? The irrepressible rightwing blogger <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/guidofawkes\">Guido Fawkes</a> declared it “beyond sublime, this is peak Corbynismo”. The Spectator’s Steerpike emphasised Corbyn’s distinctive facialhair, a visual trope picked up in cover design by Evan Johnston. Joe Linker’s The Coming of the Toads saw parallels with the songs of Woody Guthrie. Harry Giles’s review in the politics section of Prospect asked ‘What can poets really add to an ongoing political debate?’ His piece concluded that poets are reengaging with politics through inventive agitprop, powerful polemics and just a little humour.</p> <p>As a free ebook, <em>Poets for Corbyn</em> lends itself well to sharing through social media at a time when speed is of the essence as the leadership vote gets under way. After all, there really was little warning given to the literary community of Corbyn’s rise to prominence. He’s only been an MP for 32 years.</p> <p><em>• The PDF is available at </em><a

of identity, and magic collide in this powerfully written, frequently troubling, always gripping story of kidnap and voodoo set in Puerto Rico. </p> <p> Paul Faustino, South America’s premier sports journalist, is meant to be relaxing and researching his book in San Juan, but finds himself dragged against his will, first by his own insatiable journalist’s curiosity, eventually in a more sinister sense, into the mystery surrounding the disappearance of El Brujito, ‘The Magician’: a teenage football prodigy. One of the great strengths of Mal Peet as a storyteller and a writer is that none of his characters, least of all his protagonists, are ever completely likeable: Faustino is sarcastic, sometimes to the point of cruelty; he is also occasionally lazy, selfish, and somewhat prone to distraction by beautiful women and men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d4644a90e9ab04144f39e62984c2e4be46f27dba\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/14/1439564843263/d897fdfb-78d0-4325-aba1-acc9830f1d42-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"mal \" width=\"191\" height=\"295\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The reader is immersed in evocative descriptions of South America, which are sprinkled with rich details: “in this part of the world kidnapping’s the second most popular sport after football”, opines one cynical journalist; “[Paul] embarked on a five-course meal that involved both scrambled eggs and chocolate cake … stoke up with calories early in the day then eke them out … [through] the humidity”; characters eat meals cooked in “palm oil” and walk on “harshly cobbled streets”. </p> <p> Interwoven with this story is a first person, stream of consciousness account of an African man being torn from his home to work as a slave in the sugar plantations of the Americas. These sections have a lyrical, almost hallucinatory quality about them, which, juxtaposed with the naked brutality of what is being described – the horrors of the mid-Atlantic passage; a man seeing his wife being raped; the almost unimaginably harsh conditions on the plantations – only make them more disturbing. Mal Peet’s writing here has a profoundly upsetting beauty even as he describes appalling things. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> “The air was so full of screaming that I could hardly breathe it.” </p> <p> “I thought I would … wander this water desert forever.”</p> </blockquote> <p> The way these stories are interlinked and start to melt into one another is strange, disquieting and utterly riveting. </p> <p> The reader is also made to feel complicit in some of the story’s darker themes. This is a novel which deals with slavery and its legacy. Paul Faustino is made by a tour guide to stand in the same position as a captive African man would in a former slave market; at another point, the journalist watches a ritual based on the ancestor worship of the slaves. To what extent is this cultural appropriation from a civilization from which white men have already stolen everything? To what extent is it actually helping to keep these traditions and beliefs alive? Are the people performing the rituals in a sense prostituting their own heritage for white tourists’ amusement as a necessary way to preserve it? For you, the reader, who keeps turning the pages regardless, expecting to be entertained by Mal Peet – what’s your stake in this debate? Are you entirely neutral? </p> <p> Of course, to some extent The Penalty<em> </em>stands and falls on whether or not it is a good football novel. Luckily, some of Mal Peet’s most exquisite writing describes the heart-stopping, adrenaline-fuelled motion of a football game: “Brujito would, somehow, by some outrageous magic, get the ball into it”. Mal Peet is clearly writing from the point of view of a football lover, not just an author trying to engage young people by writing about the beautiful game. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Mal Peet once said that “Writing is a form of licensed madness”, arguing that if he tried to imagine what it would be like to be a ‘black South American football superstar’ or a pregnant ‘female pop celebrity’ in public he would be sectioned. I think that reading Mal Peet’s novel The Penalty<em> </em>is a form of mind-altering experience; you enter a world so completely alien to your own, and don’t return quite the same. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/penalty.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a>.</strong><br /></li> </ul> <h2>Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</h2>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>Secret Scribbler:</strong> ‘The way the two stories are interlinked and start to melt into one another is strange, disquieting and utterly riveting’","headline":"The Penalty by Mal Peet – review","byline":"Secret Scribbler","commentable":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-08-28T08:00:06Z","standfirst":"<p>‘The way the two stories are interlinked and start to melt into one another is strange, disquieting and utterly riveting’</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/28/the-penalty-mal-peet-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/28/the-penalty-mal-peet-review","sectionName":"Children's books","tags":[{"id":"childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","webTitle":"Children's books","type":"blog","sectionId":"childrens-books-site","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","sectionName":"Children's books","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","webTitle":"Children and teenagers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/teen-books","webTitle":"Teen books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/teen-books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/teen-books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/childrens-user-reviews","webTitle":"Children's user reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/childrens-user-reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/childrens-user-reviews","references":[]}]},{"id":"books/2015/aug/28/the-loney-andrew-michael-hurley-review-gothic-novel","elements":[{"id":"4c134093993538065fe101137be08cc5345873cd","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440615633061/Black-cone-lighthouse-at--005.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Alamy","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440615633061/Black-cone-lighthouse-at--005.jpg","source":"Alamy","photographer":"","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Black cone lighthouse at the entrance to the River Lune, the area known as the Loney","suppliersReference":"BNRKB0","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: /Alamy","caption":"Loney territory … Lancashire.

Often, novels are claimed for the gothic because of a creaking stair or an imperilled maiden; yet true gothic lies not merely in tropes – though these are to be prized – but in an expression of transgression, madness or desire that makes the unnerved reader complicit in the tale. With the publication of Andrew Michael Hurley’s debut <em>The Loney</em>, every gothic bookshelf must make room for a new addition.</p> <p>The Loney is “a wild and useless length” of the northwest English coastline to which Smith, the narrator, returns repeatedly in memory. The novel opens with the discovery of a child’s body on Coldbarrow in the bay of the Loney; evidently something nasty once happened out there in the mud. The story is disclosed in passages moving between the past and the deeper past; at all times the reader is conscious of the adult Smith as a man unable to slip the surly bonds of childhood. In that childhood, Smith and his brother Hanny are taken by their bitterly devout mother to a religious retreat overlooking the Loney. Together with a priest and sundry devotees, they are to visit a shrine in the hope of curing Hanny, who is mute.</p> <p>The Easter rituals in which their mother trusts have a sinister quality: the hurling of stones; the burning of marzipan to represent the perfidious Judas. It all seems merely the shoring up of pebbles against a ruinous tide, for beyond the walls another cast awaits: the muddied natives of the Loney; a spiv in a Daimler; a girl in a wheelchair. The reader grows conscious of a kind of metaphysical battle taking place, with Hanny and his brother caught between the conventions of the Catholic faith and the unreasoned wildness of the natural world, with neither side plainly either wicked or good. The novel grapples with faith’s position on the borderline between reason and unreason: Smith is haunted not only by events on the Loney but by something deeper in the past, when a stint as an altar boy was overshadowed by a priest’s falling out of faith into unhappy unbelief.</p> <p>Hurley suspends the story in a limbo between the supernatural and the merely strange: it is not clear whether the fantastic has occurred, or whether characters are mad, or which of these would be worse. Where the supernatural is most explicitly suggested (a hawthorn blooming well before its season, say), it is done almost in passing, so that one may begin to doubt one’s own experience of the novel. This putting out of a hand to tug the reader into the text is at the crux of the gothic, and is as rare as it is delicious.</p> <p>Knowing use of form in fiction is at times looked on askance (God forbid you deploy, for example, the pathetic fallacy). But a novelist expert in form should be no less praised than a poet who knows her English sonnet from her Petrarchan, and there is such pleasure in seeing Hurley go about his craft. Defining characteristics of the gothic are wonderfully present and correct: the house falling into decrepitude; a girl’s face glimpsed at a wet window; villainy encroaching on innocence. The uncanny is handled with particular skill: Smith’s parents are known as “Mummer and Farther”, the homely endearments altered to suggest masks and isolation. Ordinary life – traffic on the North Circular, a plastic dinosaur – beomes no less unnerving than a pig’s heart falling from a hanging effigy. When horror comes, it comes late, and lightly, and is all the more shocking for it.</p> <p>While not faultless – some passages might have been tightened by another turn of the screw – Hurley’s prose style is perfectly fitted to the form, mingling vivid descriptive phrases (“Stone walls shone like iron”) with an ear for the oddness of conversation.</p> <p>Back in the time of the guilds, an apprentice was required to submit a masterpiece to attain the status of a master craftsman. It was not the peerless and crowning achievement of a career, but the moment he showed mastery of the craft. Well, then – here is the masterpiece by which Hurley must enter the Guild of the Gothic: it pleases me to think of his name written on some parchment scroll, alongside those of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/20/horace-walpole-strawberry-hill\" title=\"\">Walpole</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/daphnedumaurier\" title=\"\">Du Maurier</a>, Maturin and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\" title=\"\">Jackson</a>.</p> <p>• Sarah Perry’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/after-me-comes-the-flood.html\" title=\"\"><em>After Me Comes the Flood</em></a> is published by Serpent’s Tail.

<em>(noun)</em>: a statement at the start of any piece of writing, video, etc, alerting the reader or viewer to the fact that it contains material they might find upsetting or offensive.</p> </blockquote> <p>T<em>rigger Warning</em> is a long and fierce defence of the right to unrestricted freedom of speech including “hate-speech”. A rich resource, it contains nearly all of the key cases and quotations you’ll need to understand this extremely difficult issue. It’s also highly repetitive, and few will finish it in its present form. Mick Hume should hire an implacable copy editor, cut the book by 100 pages in an immediate second edition and spin off a separate incandescent pamphlet (50 pages maximum) aimed at achieving the kind of sales Harry Frankfurt enjoyed with <em>On Bullshit</em>.</p> <p>I hope he will, because the wide circulation of <em>Trigger Warning</em> could do some good. It’s a polemic, but might calm us down. We need something like this, because the “moronic inferno” of the media (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/saulbellow\">Saul Bellow</a>’s phrase) has grown more intense over the last 20 years and has become more malignant. It caters increasingly to what personality psychologists call “the Dark Tetrad”: sadism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy and narcissism (these traits have been shown to be strongly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/feb/25/internet-trolls-are-also-real-life-trolls\">linked to internet trolling</a>). We’re surrounded by outrage-junkies – a snarling festival of mutual intolerance. The public air is poisoned by identity politics, rampant tribalism related to ethnic or religious identity, based on sexual preference, sexual equipment, disability, national identity, which football team you support, hair colour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/11/sapiens-brief-history-humankind-yuval-noah-harari-review\">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari – review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s hard to shut the problem out. The words of Tom Lehrer’s 1965 song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAOwYDlEQXo\">National Brotherhood Week</a>” (“Oh, the white folks hate the black folks, / And the black folks hate the white folks / To hate all but the right folks / Is an old established rule … Oh, the Protestants hate the Catholics, And the Catholics hate the Protestants, And the Hindus hate the Muslims, And everybody hates the Jews … ”) aren’t more accurate now than when they were written, but there are new hatreds, and we are constantly confronted by them.</p> <p>What should we do? Hume thinks we have to put up with them. We human beings love to jeer and disparage. So be it; we can’t weaponise our repulsion. The worst insults are full of passionate intensity, but speech must be free. “One man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric,” as US supreme court Justice Harlan pointed out in 1971 when he reversed the conviction of a man for wearing a jacket reading “Fuck the Draft” in the corridors of a California courthouse.</p> <p>Hume quotes Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr, another US supreme court justice: we have above all to defend “freedom for the thought that we hate”. He also quotes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/feb/07/spinoza-philosophy-god-world\">Spinoza</a>: “In a free state, every man may think what he likes and say what he thinks.” (Spinoza is himself quoting a passage from Tacitus – “the rare happiness of times when you can think what you like and say what you think” – that David Hume used as the epigraph to his <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/treatise-of-human-nature.html\"><em>Treatise of Human Nature</em></a>.) Mick Hume thinks this freedom is in danger. University campuses in particular have become petri dishes of intolerance, dictating what we can and can’t say. But we have to take it. We have to put up with the worst people saying the worst – ignoble, repellent, ignominious – things. We have to be constantly ashamed of our species.</p> <p>The price is high. It must be paid, but I think Hume underestimates it. He reproduces a famous sentence from Evelyn Hall’s book <em>The Friends of Voltaire</em> that is often mistakenly attributed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2015/jan/18/beginners-guide-voltaire-philosopher-free-speech-tolerance\">Voltaire</a> – “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it” – and calls his enemies “the reverse-Voltaires, whose slogan is, ‘I know I will detest what you say, and I will defend to the end of free speech my right to stop you saying it’.” I’m not a reverse-Voltaire, but I’m something just as bad, in Hume’s typology: a “but-head”, someone who says, “I believe in freedom of speech, but … ” Anyone who says “but” must deny that the right to free speech is “indivisible”. Hume thinks that’s a fatal mistake: if you allow any exceptions, the dividing line between permitted and forbidden is no longer perfectly sharp, and you’re on a slippery slope, risking more and more restrictions. I disagree: the line is no longer sharp, but it’s not true that we’re on a slippery slope. The first amendment of the US constitution states categorically that “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press” (Hume calls it “the global gold standard” of free speech). The court’s defence of the first amendment over the years shows how the line can be held even after exceptions are allowed, for it does place limits on free speech – for example, on “fighting words”, deliberately intended and likely to incite “imminent lawless action”; on explicit threats against specific targets; and on false shouts of “Fire!” in a crowded theatre.</p> <p>Hume admits these exceptions to unrestricted free speech, and then makes a rationalisation that he condemns elsewhere: he says they’re “not cases of free speech”, “not about free speech at all”. Yet each states quite plainly and correctly that you can’t say what you like, where you like, when you like: they place a limit on speech.</p> <p>So Hume is himself a “but-head”, rightly so. And his admiration for the first amendment requires him to address an issue he omits: the fact that it was used to justify <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jan/20/supreme-court-rulings-citizens-united-election\">Citizens United</a>, the 2010 US supreme court ruling that opened the way for corporations to contribute unlimited funds to political causes, and, in effect, buy the leaders they want, most notably by funding political “attacks ads” on television. Here free speech is free speech for the rich and, by the same token, the silencing of the poor. For while the poor can say and publish what they want, they will not be heard by the mass of the electorate. Hume criticises the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/communications-act\">UK Communications Act 2003</a> on free-speech grounds, but in this case it does more for the cause of free speech than the first amendment, by prohibiting political advertising on television or radio and ensuring equality of air time (mercifully brief) for the major parties’ party political broadcasts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/trigger-warnings-dont-hinder-freedom-expression\">Trigger warnings don’t hinder freedom of expression: they expand it | Lindy West</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hume may be right that, in addition to this act, a number of laws recently enacted in the UK – the Public Order Act 1986, the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, the Terrorism Act 2006, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/13/criminal-justice-immigration-act\">Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008</a> – contain sections that wouldn’t stand up if tested against the first amendment.</p> <p>He thinks we should never flinch at words, but I don’t think he understands their force. When I set out for the Middle East, aged 16, I met up with a friend who was then living in a Christian community in Switzerland and spent a few days there before we set off to hitchhike to Greece. We spent most of the next four months together and I acquired an acute sensitivity to religious swearing (and, for all I remember, to all swearing). According to Hume, such sensitivity is invariably grounded in ego, and is inseparable from feelings of outrage and offence. None of these things applied in my case. The feeling I developed when hearing such swearing was simply one of shock and intense dismay. I got over it, but I know what it’s like. I don’t think Hume does.</p> <p>It’s essential to his case that the line between harm from words and harm from physical blows is perfectly sharp. But it isn’t. Privately, at least, some find verbal abuse harder to take than physical cruelty. Hume seems to endorse an old false dualism of mind and body that supposes the mind to be always less vulnerable than the body. On this basis he slams the “liberal elite” for insulting and infantilising “the people”, treating us as weak, pathetically impressionable, “one big susceptible infantile blob”, desperately in need of protection from hurtful words. The problem is that Hume enjoys his assault on the “ethical elite” too much to acknowledge the power of words – even though their power is crucial to his case for free speech. It’s worth adding that we’re all “the people”, and we really are hopelessly weak, impressionable and comically self-ignorant. We’re often deeply mistaken about why we’re doing what we’re doing (see <em>Strangers to Ourselves</em> by Timothy Wilson or <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, by Daniel Kahneman). This isn’t a snooty judgment passed by the elite on the masses; Hume’s model of the robustly autonomous citizen is in profound ways a fiction. It is, perhaps, a fiction we need to maintain, but that’s another matter.</p> <p>It doesn’t help that Hume himself belongs to a certain elite – of professional writers and talkers, toughened journalists, politicians and polemicists who know how to give it and take it. (He has been editor of the Revolutionary Communist Party’s paper, and of Living Marxism and the web-only Spiked.) He has a tough mental shell, by nature and training, and it puts him in a position of high privilege in this debate. He can sing “Sticks and stones may break my bones / But words can never harm me” with a full throat, and lambast people such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/stephen-fry\">Stephen Fry</a> who adjust the second line to “words will always harm me” (or even, “only words can harm me”).</p> <p>Another consequence of his carapace is that he doesn’t offer much advice about how to put up with verbal thuggery, except to say that one can always fight back with words. He isn’t deterred by the ancient adage “he that wrastleth with a turd shall be beshitt, fall he over or under”. Others are. I find it useful to remember that insults are boomerangs; they whip back unerringly into the face of the insulter. This isn’t merely an uplifting fiction, it’s true without exception, whatever else may be going on. It’s worth training oneself into hearing it. It can speed one past the flash of fury or thud of dismay.</p> <p>Hume also says very little about images and pornography. This is perhaps the most serious omission in the book. The easy availability of pornography is a tragedy – not just because it makes it far harder for someone to acquire a capacity for sexual love and hence for the best sex. There’s a close parallel between what chronic indulgence in pornography does to the mind and what chronic overeating of bad food does to the body, although sexual mental obesity isn’t immediately visible in the way that bodily obesity is.</p> <p>Hume thinks that the fundamental cause of outrage and offence is narcissism. In fact it’s something vastly more toxic: righteous indignation felt on behalf of others – typically a group with which one identifies or sympathises. Righteous indignation can stem from concern for the powerless; it can be a good thing. More often than not, however, it’s something uniquely ugly, very human, very dangerous, arguably the most noxious force in public affairs. It’s precisely because such righteous indignation is not narcissistic, and is not experienced as mere self-concern, that it comes with a feeling of absolute purity – purity of cause and of justification – that seems to license absolute violence. As often as not, it’s driven by people’s unconscious anger with themselves or their lives, and this gives it frightening power. Hitched to a seemingly unselfish cause, the anger is cleared to express itself without inhibition.</p> <p>I strongly recommend this book. Hume is right that the current proliferation of trigger warnings is absurd, even if he is too dismissive of our sensitivities. But he is, finally, wrong to think that he is “always with that great Englishman of letters Dr Samuel Johnson”. When he quotes Johnson’s remark that “every man has the right to utter what he thinks truth – and every other man has a right to knock him down for it”, he has to interpret “knock down” as a matter of words only. He doesn’t mention Johnson’s view (recorded in the same paragraph of Boswell’s<em> Life of Johnson</em>) that “the state has a right to regulate the religion of the people”. Nor does he cite Johnson’s response, when discussing religion, to the claim “that no man could be hurt by another man’s differing from him in opinion”: “Sir, you are to a certain degree hurt by knowing that even one man does not believe.”</p> <p>• To order <em>Trigger Warning</em> for £10.39 go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/292878/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;ut m_medium=\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Take the picture book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/apr/08/trial-lesson-ideas-primary-school-job-interview\" title=\"\">Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type</a>. Clearly, Doreen Cronin’s story of Farmer Brown’s woes isn’t just a charming tale about a man and his cows. (Briefly: after the cows find a typewriter in the barn they start sending Farmer Brown notes, via the ducks, demanding fringe benefits and threatening to go on strike if he doesn’t comply.) Around the 100th reading, it becomes an allegory of the decentralising influence of communications technology and the enduring power of the unions. Fifty reads later, and it’s a critique of American decadence. (The cows aren’t demanding shorter working hours, but electric blankets.)</p> <p>The better the book, the more inaccessible the meaning. So <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/27/booksforchildrenandteenagers.features2\" title=\"\">The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog!</a> is about sharing, yawn. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2014/mar/26/very-hungry-caterpillar-gallery-eric-carle\" title=\"\">Very Hungry Caterpillar</a> reminds us of renewal, a self-help book for six-month-olds. And then there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/29/judith-kerr-tiger-came-tea\" title=\"\">Judith Kerr’s The Tiger Who Came to Tea</a>, that 1968 classic in which a tiger drops in unexpectedly on Sophie and her mother, eats all the cakes and buns, drinks everything in sight, and leaves, never to return. When Sophie’s dad comes home, there’s nothing to eat and they have to go “down the road to a cafe” for dinner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/29/judith-kerr-tiger-came-tea\">Interview: Judith Kerr, author of The Tiger Who Came to Tea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I think it’s about stay-at-home mums,” said the friend who gave me the book. “About how much harder it is than it looks.”</p> <p>“I think it’s like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2001/sep/29/theatre.artsfeatures1\" title=\"\">An Inspector Calls</a>,” I said; the tiger is the idea that jolts us into self-awareness. “Unless he’s Christ, like Aslan.”</p> <p>“Why would Christ ‘drink all the water in the tap’?” asked my friend.</p> <p>“I see what you mean.”</p> <p>After a further 20 readings I think: wait, what if the tiger is actually Sophie’s dad? Who wanted to eat dinner at the cafe all along and who, when he gets home, is weirdly uncurious about their afternoon visitor? Or what if the cat on the penultimate page is actually the tiger, and the whole thing is a piece of undeclared make-believe?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>The better the book, the more inaccessible the meaning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My dad visited recently and while he was reading the book, suddenly it came to me.</p> <p>“I think the tiger is Death,” I said. Like Memento Mori or the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jul/20/worldcinema.drama1\" title=\"\">Seventh Seal</a>, the tiger is a long-range reminder that one of these days there will be no more cakes and tea.</p> <p>My dad looked alarmed. “I think you’re over-thinking it,” he said.</p> <h2><strong>Rain mum</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Before the babies, I thought mainly about lunch. At any given point in the day, the thing I was most likely to be saying was “Do you want lunch?”, or “What did you have for lunch?”, or “I had tuna salad for lunch”. It was like the shipping forecast, a ritual only loosely connected to external reality.</p> <p>Lunch, now, is whatever I can scavenge in three minutes from the fridge, and I realise that the thing I’m most likely to be caught saying – with the reflexive, unvarying cadence of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz-ihW8RXSM\" title=\"\">Rain Man’s “Who’s on first base?”</a> – is “Are you pooping?”. I have only to catch sight of a baby, red-faced and straining or placid and sweet, and there it is, soothing as the sea.</p> <h2><strong>Long Island Les Dawsons </strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Driving in Long Island at the weekend, someone had put out tomatoes from their garden: misshapen and huge, with rubbery faces, like Les Dawson. A sign said, “Ugly tomatoes, please take”. The term “ugly tomatoes” is a valid description in agrarian circles, but I felt such a stab of pity for them. What a terrible thing to say, I thought.

recommend: melancholy songs | Peter Kimpton","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-08-27T19:00:12Z","fields":{"wordcount":"1311","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4bzby","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>“Misery is the river of the world,” grunts out an energetically downbeat Tom Waits. “Melancholy is sadness that has taken on lightness,” replies the eccentric, upbeat author Italo Calvino. And, now also entering the Readers Recommend bar (you never know who might turn up), here’s Rob Spragg, aka Larry Love, from Alabama 3. He decides to do a spontaneous gig, as I’ve seen him do a couple of times, and, no matter how what the subject matter or how upbeat the style, he dryly remarks, with a twinkle in the eye, and that gravelly voice - ‘Here’s another sad song for ya!”</p> <p>For what is melancholy? It is more than sadness. It is a nuanced mix of emotions that seems steeped in articulacy. It implies there’s something to say about a state of mind and the state of the world. Arguably melancholy is as much a driving force to songwriting as any idea or emotion. Is it a functional form of depression? Perhaps. If so, it certainly served to be so for the likes of Nick Drake, or Joni Mitchell, who later admitted to suffering from such a state throughout the writing of several of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/joni-mitchell-blue-hissing-summer-lawns-court-spark-hejira-dylan\">her most acclaimed albums</a>.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bb9f6baca562f4cf7bbec9b87ebf3ecd6de511b8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/25/1440524490669/1f3cce13-6f03-4f7e-b47b-796b622a3c9d-364x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Portrait of John Donne ca. 1595.\" width=\"364\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portrait of John Donne ca. 1595.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Gallery Collection/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The best known and earliest work on the subject is Robert Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholie (1621), a scholarly analysis of proto-psychology, describing what was then thought of as an imbalance of the four humours. The first rock star of the genre, however, was undoubtedly the poet John Donne (1573–1631), known for his many erotic affairs, and lovelorn elegies on their passing. His poems range from the deeply intimate, earthy and sexual, to the most profoundly complex, and religiously ethereal. They include lines such as “Love built on beauty, soon as beauty, dies,” (Elegy II) and “The day breaks not, it is my heart,” (Stay O Sweet). In short, Donne was a something of a serial, but sensitive seducer, as well as sad, dirty sod, and had remarkable gift of the gab. Sounds like a successful formula. What kind of superstar he would be now we can only imagine.<br /></p> <p>Melancholy, however, seems to be most associated with two things. Lying down and being forlorn, and secondly, twizzling your abundant head of hair with a despondent look. Think of the mass of long locks and facial expressions Jim Morrison, a younger Neil Young or Amy Winehouse, and it gives a whole new dimension to that famous phrase from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet - “parting is such sweet sorrow”.<br /></p> <p>Yet even Marcel Proust, who spent a lot of time lying down on the sofa and munching madeleine cakes for comfort, described, with a number of characteristic sub-clauses,<em> </em>“that melancholy which we feel when we cease to obey orders which, from one day to another, keep the future hidden, and realise that we have at last begun to live in real earnest, as a grownup person, the life, the only life that any of us has at his disposal.” Melancholy is about facing the sadness of things. It may contain despair, ennui, depression, pessimism and weltschmerz, all of which hurts, but can it, as Susan Cadogan and others put it, “hurt so good”? Melancholy may even have a big dash of rebellion about it too, alongside a profound feeling of illumination. So even if you can’t do anything about it, you can at least describe it. And why write a 1,000-page novel when you can do a four-minute song?</p> <p>Mexican culture has a strong fixaction with melancholy, stemming from tragedy and death. Is that why Morrissey, for one, is so popular in this region of the world? Is it the lyrics or the music? Your suggestions could imply both.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81cb74f749072a7f6ec577c772bc2ba497278ea6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440608360577/c292fe63-dea5-4a2c-ac76-ea36d2c88436-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Morrissey\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Who would have thought this bookish fellow from Stretford in Manchester would touch the melancholy hearts of so many Mexicans?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We can find melancholy everywhere - in the news, in our daily lives.

Anybody claiming it?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall McDiarmid/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Melancholy runs through music like a message through a stick of rock. It is deep in the DNA. But perhaps of all genres, including country and folk, the strongest roots of the melancholy tree grow from the blues. “The blues is instilled in every musical cell that floats around your body,” says Nick Cave, who is among an army of rock and pop musicians, from the Beatles to the Stones to Tom Waits and Jack White and many more across the decades extolling the influence of Robert Johnson et al from the early 20th century onwards. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48994b509020a99bac9bd0d917c927283d27cc14\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440608527472/1094ff12-16e2-4e6a-bce0-002e938a6eed-375x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Blues singer-songwriter and guitarist Robert Johnson (1911-1938), left, with fellow blues musician Johnny Shines (1915-1992), circa 1935.\" width=\"375\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blues singer-songwriter and guitarist Robert Johnson (1911-1938), left, with fellow blues musician Johnny Shines (1915-1992), circa 1935.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So now the RR bar is really filling up now with artists wanting to say something about the blues. Here’s Amy Winehouse with her big hair and melancholy smile: “Every bad situation is a blues song waiting to happen.” How right you are, Amy. Now here’s Jimi Hendrix, who can play anything, but concedes that: “Blues is easy to play, but hard to feel.” Alexis Korner chips in now, hinting how functional melancholy can be: “I guess music, particularly the blues, is the only form of schizophrenia that has organised itself into being both legal and beneficial to society.” <br /></p> <p>Mahalia Jackson’s voice floats higher and louder than anyone at this week’s RR party. She herself finds he blues too dark, and puts in a word for a lighter side of melancholy, and says: “Blues are the songs of despair, but gospel songs are the songs of hope.” And finally, comes a comment from an unexpected source - Peter Tork from the Monkees. Does he have a cure for the blues? No. Because the blues are the preventative cure: “Pop music is aspirin and the blues are vitamins.”<br />So then, join this rich mix of melancholy songwriters and performers to suggest you many songs on this subject.

Wimbledon Poisoner taught me the exoticism of suburbia | Catherine Shoard","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-08-27T18:02:08Z","fields":{"wordcount":"777","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4bq6z","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>In 1990 Nigel Williams published <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/wimbledon-poisoner.html\" title=\"\">The Wimbledon Poisoner</a>, a comedy about a dull solicitor who tries to kill his wife, fails repeatedly, but tops a lot of neighbours in the process. It sold 150,000 copies – about the same as the new Nick Hornby or David Nicholls shifts in print these days.</p> <p>One of these copies came into my possession when I was about 11. I reread it religiously. I even made incredibly dim pencil notes in my paperback. I’d have picked it up because we lived in Raynes Park, one stop along the railway line, several steps down the swank ladder, but still an easy enough puff up the hill into SW19, with its tree-lined streets of mock Tudor semis, its posh school and its fancy village, its pubs rich in local history, which the book’s hero, Henry Farr, has detailed in a Casaubon-ish book called The Complete History of Wimbledon, which nobody wants to publish.</p> <p>Rage about this rejection, about being felt – by himself included – to be boring, and about being remorselessly exploited by his awful wife, Elinor, turns Henry’s thoughts to slaughter. The first attempt, involving thallium-laced chicken, goes wrong when his friend Donald comes by for supper unexpectedly. Henry’s next, involving Finish ’Em! bleach in the punch at Donald’s wake is more indiscriminate but, again, Elinor remains unscathed. Both incidents draw the couple closer together. Elinor softens as her husband becomes empowered. But Henry’s resolve not to kill her coincides with what must be his imminent arrest.</p> <p>The Wimbledon Poisoner is a weird book. There is brilliant observational patter, plus a couple of stone-cold farce masterpieces (buying the poison, trying to stop Donald scoffing) that even the most resistant would struggle not to snigger at. There is, through most of it, a fluent mix of whimsy and something more astringent, more cross. Henry is, actually, a complex chap, a scatological Pooter, stricken with a chirpier type of malaise than that suffered by Reggie Perrin, his neighbour over Norbiton – but an existential crisis none the less.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Rage about being felt – by himself included – to be boring turns Henry’s thoughts to slaughter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet there are also gags and conceits evidently dashed off (Williams wrote it while at the BBC). Writing that blurs the line between the colloquial and the facile. Once the first few deeds are done, the plot wobbles, and the appearance of a mysterious policeman slows momentum and worries the genre.</p> <p>But, at 11, I wouldn’t have noticed. Even cliches come fresh once in your life. I simply found it hysterically funny. Not just the set pieces but all the incidentals about south-west London life, the hopeless piano lessons and the obsession with car paintwork, the wrangles over hedges, the Waitrose runs and the twitching nets. Likewise, Williams’s digs at feminist therapy wouldn’t have struck me as blunt, but rather as heat-seeking missiles bravely lobbed into uncharted territory.</p> <p>This was a book that encouraged me to laugh at people whose wealth had previously seemed to put them more off-limits, and at a place which posited itself as aspirational. It ticked off Wimbledon, called it lazy and reactionary, scoffed at its sense of style. I loved Wodehouse, but he wrote fairytales, poking loving fun at an absurd aristocracy. I liked Waugh, what I clocked of it, but again: this was a class not often encountered. Now, suddenly, here was satire that spoke to me.</p> <p>And it wasn’t just piss-take. It was celebration, too. The Wimbledon Poisoner crackles with ambivalence about the value of the suburbs; whether the decency of the project compensates for the parochialism that can rear up once its neat borders are challenged. But it also shows these borders to be anthropologically exotic as anywhere else on the planet. The front doorstep can be a place of wonder. And if you did spend a lot of time in Wimbledon’s fallout zone, this was a helpful thing to keep in mind.</p> <p>The later two instalments of Williams’s Wimbledon trilogy didn’t hit home so forcefully for me. Alien invasion-themed They Came from SW19 was too wacky; the David Nobbs meets Michel Houellebecq vibe of fundamentalist fantasy East of Wimbledon went way over my head. Five years later, a BBC adaptation of Poisoner pretty much turned me off it for good.</p> <p>Still, I hope the book changed me.

films about the rise and ultimate fall of Julius Caesar, from the studio behind The Hunger Games, is heading to multiplexes, <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2015/08/emperor-julius-caesar-marcus-brutus-lionsgate-conn-iggulden-1201506981/\">reports Deadline</a>.</p> <p>Lionsgate, which also oversaw the final two movies in the blockbuster Twilight saga, has optioned <a href=\"http://www.conniggulden.com/books/series/the-emperor-series#\">Conn Iggulden’s Emperor series of novels</a> with the initial aim of making three films. Also titled Emperor, the planned triptych will detail Caesar’s childhood friendship with Marcus Brutus, the pair’s rise to power, and the Roman leader’s final betrayal on the floor of the senate at the hands of his lifelong comrade. </p> <p>“We’re looking forward to working with an incredible creative team on Emperor, a great property based on a unique and compelling series of books,” said Lionsgate Motion Picture Group co-chairs Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger. “A fresh and inventive coming-of-age story about the young Julius Caesar and Brutus set amid the drama, intrigue and passions of ancient Rome, we believe that Emperor will be a big, crowd-pleasing motion picture event for global audiences.”</p> <p>Producers Mark Canton, of Atmosphere Entertainment, and Gianni Nunnari, of Hollywood Gang Productions, said the trilogy would combine the “sweep of 300 with the intrigue of Game of Thrones”, adding: “This is the part of the story of the mighty Julius Caesar that nobody knows – his emergence alongside Brutus as young powerhouses in Rome, a fresh and contemporary retelling of their rivalries, passions and jealousies, captured in a movie with breathtaking action, spectacular visual effects and epic scope.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/21/hugh-jackman-embarks-on-the-odyssey-homer\">Heading Homer: Hugh Jackman embarks on The Odyssey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A script by a somewhat concerning multitude of screenwriters is in place for the first movie. Cast Away and Apollo 13’s William Broyles Jr heads the list of names, but Stephen Harrigan, best known for the 1990s television miniseries Cleopatra, Pride, Prejudice and Zombies’ Burr Steers and The Grey’s Ian Mackenzie Jeffers have also had input. No director has yet been named, and casting details are thin on the ground.</p> <p>Lionsgate’s announcement of a trilogy tallies with a recent propensity for Hollywood studios to unveil expansive plans for multiple film sagas from the beginning, where once executives might have shot a single movie and paused to see if it achieved box-office success before launching plans for a sequel. Disney’s new ream of Star Wars films, Marvel’s Avengers superhero movies and Warner Bros’ Fantastic Beasts are all examples of series that have been planned as multiple instalment sagas from the beginning.

Rimington on mission to 'rescue spy stories from blokes'","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-08-27T16:26:14Z","fields":{"wordcount":"675","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4bzpe","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>The former head of MI5 Stella Rimington told the Edinburgh international book festival that after retiring from her job, she set herself a new mission – to “rescue spy stories from the blokes.” </p> <p>Rimington, who joined the security service as a typist in 1968 and became its its first female director general in 1992, is following up last year’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/18/crimebooks.features\">Close Call</a> by working on her ninth novel featuring heroine Liz Carlyle. <br /></p> <p>“When you think about it, all fictional spies are blokes, and spy writers when I started were chaps too. So I was certain that my character was going to be female. I wanted her to reflect accurately what a female does in my former service.” <br /> </p> <p>Though she has preciously been quoted as saying <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3130556/Former-MI5-chief-says-women-make-best-spies.html\">women make better spies</a> than men, she now dismisses the idea as “rubbish”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2015/aug/25/stars-of-the-edinburgh-international-books-festival-in-pictures\">Stars of the Edinburgh International book festival - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“People often say women make better spies than men. But of course that’s rubbish. Everybody behaves in a different way. Two men will behave differently and two women will behave in different ways … What you need in intelligence services is diversity. You need both sexes to bring that element of surprise. Women have certain different qualities, I think. Women are better at listening than men. Maybe they say less and listen more, and maybe their methods of persuasion are different. But in an ideal world you choose the best person for the job.”</p> <p>Rimington, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/oct/19/stella-rimington-booker-diatribe-kgb\">chaired the Man Booker prize in 2011</a>, also said the most unsafe she ever felt in her 28-year career was when her appointment as director general went public. With no press plan in place, she said, a tabloid chase forced her family to flee their “ordinary London street” to a block of flats. They took their dog and a suitcase. <br /></p> <p>“We had headlines like ‘Housewife super spy’ and suchlike. Who was this woman who’s holding a man’s job? They came round and took photographs of the house and that was the trigger to when we started feeling very unsafe. It was at a time when the IRA had active units in London. One of them was arrested and in their pocket they had this cutting of our house. <br /></p> <p>“That was the point I felt most unsafe. Here was me and Harriet, my younger daughter, exposed in a sense, without proper protection. We worked it out in the end and lived covertly for the rest of my time there, never getting letters to the house or anything like that. Harriet learned how to be a spy very quickly. She was 16.”<br /></p> <p>Elsewhere at the festival, as part of a music strand hosted by crime writer and uber-fan Ian Rankin, Edwyn Collins revealed that he was working on a new album.</p> <p>The former Orange Juice singer, who suffered a crippling stroke in 2005, was accompanied on stage by his wife Grace Maxwell, who helped him play guitar as he sang two songs: Searching for the Truth and A Girl Like You, the 1994 hit that made his name. </p> <p>They described how the 56-year-old singer had learned how to read again using books aimed at dyslexics, which they discovered from an independent Edinburgh publisher for dyslexic teenagers. “The condition took away reading, writing, everything,” Maxwell said. “He was having to do Ladybird books, it was crazy. Things like Janet and John. We wanted something with a bit of meat on it, so <a href=\"http://www.barringtonstoke.co.uk/\">Barrington Stoke books</a> were fantastic. They do books for young people with dyslexia … on a particular coloured paper, they choose the font size and spacing very carefully. It worked brilliantly for Edwyn.” </p> <p>Corrresponding on social media had also played a part in his recovery. “He had his stroke at the right time, just when social media was starting,” said Maxwell. “As much as I have an ambivalent relationship with it sometimes, for Edwyn it’s been an amazing, wonderful thing.

Tomlinson obituary","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-08-27T15:38:06Z","fields":{"wordcount":"1163","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4bq2v","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>The poet Charles Tomlinson has died aged 88, at the Gloucestershire cottage where he had lived since 1958. It is significant that this major English modernist and internationalist should have rooted himself for half a century in a quintessentially rural corner of England. He advocated the poetry of Edward Thomas, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview1\">Isaac Rosenberg</a>, Ivor Gurney and Keith Douglas before it was fashionable to do so. DH Lawrence was his witness that “all creative art must rise out of a specific soil and flicker with the spirit of place”, to which Tomlinson added: “Since we live in a time when place is threatened by the violence of change, the thought of a specific soil carries tragic implications.”</p> <p>John Betjeman said: “I hold Charles Tomlinson’s poetry in high regard. His is closely wrought work, not a word wasted … ” For the American objectivist poet George Oppen, “it is [Tomlinson] and Basil Bunting who have spoken most vividly to American poets”. Tomlinson bridged the vast gulf between old and new world poetry, and was an heir equally of Dryden and Williams, Coleridge and Pound. His 16 collections of poetry, books of essays, translations and anthologies are a core resource for English writers and readers of the last half-century, yet he has been more honoured abroad than at home.</p> <p>He was born into a working-class family, son of Alfred Tomlinson and May Lucas, in Stoke-on-Trent, “a land / Too handled to be primary – all the same / The first in feeling” (At Stoke, 1974). He contrasted his background in the Potteries with that of other working-class poets whose circumstances resulted in a politics of resentment. For his part, he was glad not to have suffered “the soft oppression of prosperity”. An early epiphany was seeing a reproduction of Van Gogh’s Sunflowers in a dentist’s waiting room. “My own long poem, The Return,” he said, “celebrates our ‘deprived’ youth which turns out to have been full of unsuspected possibilities.” He found his own way, taking nothing for granted, advancing in a spirit of heightened wakefulness.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The chances of rhyme are like the chances of meeting –</em><br /><em>In the finding fortuitous, but once found, binding …</em><br />(The Chances of Rhyme, 1969)</p> </blockquote> <p>He attended Longton high school, Staffordshire, then Queens’ College, Cambridge, taking his degree in 1948. In the same year, he married Brenda Raybould, who later became a sure interpreter of his work, attending him in his blindness and easing his difficult last years.</p> <p>After Cambridge, he became lecturer, reader and then, from 1982 until 1992, professor of English at the University of Bristol; he also taught in the US and elsewhere. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1974 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1998, was appointed CBE in 2001, and received five honorary doctorates, a Cholmondeley award from the Society of Authors, and various American and Italian honours.</p> <p>At Queens’ he studied with the young <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/obituaries/donald-davie-73-poet-and-literary-critic-dies.html\">Donald Davie</a>, who became an advocate and friend. Davie used to say that Tomlinson taught him to see, architecture in particular; and that he taught Tomlinson to read, syntax in particular. Tomlinson was a superb syntactician: his long verse sentences can unfold with Coleridgean assurance or build with Paterian design.</p> <p>He was hostile to the narrow parameters of the 1950s Movement with which Davie was associated. In poems such as More Foreign Cities (1956), he answers that narrowness not by argument but by example: the exotic actuality of a wider world, different cultures, climates and lights.</p> <p>He regretted that “the English have rather sloppy ideas about the relation between mind and feelings and one can only sigh and go on believing there is such a thing as passionate intellect”. He looked to the Italians and the French for a poetry of “sensuous cerebration”: feeling thinks, and thinking feels.</p> <p>He was impatient with verbal excess, whether of a confessional or an apocalyptic kind. “I wanted precision,” he said. “This was at the time when Dylan Thomas represented one of the norms in poetry, and the weaker side of Thomas – his playing with words as if they were Plasticine – seemed to me a threat to what I should call a civil language.” His 18th-century sense of the responsibilities of poetry, like Davie’s, looked for balance in a disrupted modern world. Unlike Davie and other contemporaries, he never became an ironist.</p> <p>Repelled by prescriptions – formal, political, religious – he maintained an alert interest in other poetries and other arts: music, architecture, sculpture, painting. He was an accomplished graphic artist. And he never tired of travel in space and language, though he always homed to his cottage in Gloucestershire, and to an English enriched by his translations from the Russian of Fyodor Tyutchev, the Spanish of Antonio Machado, César Vallejo and Octavio Paz, the Italian of Giuseppe Ungaretti and others, and the French poets. Jacques Roubaud, Edoardo Sanguineti and Paz collaborated with him on Renga (1979), a poem in four languages. His translations represented a significant second body of poetic work. He edited the seminal Oxford Book of Verse in English Translation (1980), demonstrating the centrality of translation to the history of our magpie literature, and how strategies of translation have evolved over six centuries. He agreed with the American poet Kenneth Rexroth that “translation saves you from your contemporaries”.</p> <p>Some slightly older Americans, too, saved him from his English contemporaries. William Carlos Williams “helped make clearer the inherent rubato of speech. Furthermore, I liked his ability to deal with phenomena unegotistically – a piece of paper blowing across the street, a yellow chimney emitting smoke, all the miscellany and detritus of what just lies around.” The work of Marianne Moore was one of his early transatlantic enthusiasms. Wallace Stevens proved almost too intoxicating for him, until the antidotes of Williams and Pound were applied. Louis Zukofsky and Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan and Charles Olson also affected him.</p> <p>His verse is fastidious, the images seen not just once but at different times, from different angles. In his formative years he was “obsessed by cinema. The kind of fluidity of movement and clarity of image I tried for …” In Assassin (1969), for example, he finds a whole voice for Trotsky’s murderer, gets inside his experience, and a politics anathema to his own finds expression (undermined by action).

The novel, which has sold 140,000 copies in France, goes on to reveal that the woman is not the American actor, but a lookalike, and the pair embark on a relationship.</p> <p>Johansson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/14/scarlett-johansson-sues-french-author\">sued Delacourt </a>last year, with her lawyer stating that the novel constituted a “violation and fraudulent and illegal exploitation of her name, her reputation and her image”, as well as “defamatory claims about her private life”, and set out to stop it from being translated or adapted into a film. </p> <p>The judge <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/04/scarlett-johansson-wins-french-defamation-case\">agreed that it was defamatory</a>, but threw out her claim that it should not be translated or filmed, and that it “fraudulently exploited her name, her image and her celebrity”. The actor was awarded just €2,500 (£1,600) in damages, and €2,500 in legal costs, rather than the €50,000 she had claimed.</p> <p>“All of Scarlett Johansson’s demands were rejected except one thing that was seen to be an attack in her private life over two relations that she never had,” Emmanuelle Allibert of the publishers J-C Lattès <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/04/scarlett-johansson-wins-french-defamation-case\">told the Guardian at the time</a>. “All her other demands … were rejected, notably that there should be a ban on the book being translated or made into a film. We just have to cut out the bit about the affairs.”</p> <p>Allibert said at the time that the publisher was “open to offers” about an English translation; Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson has now announced that it will publish The First Thing You See in the UK on 10 September. “What I love about Gregoire’s writing is his ability to see the extraordinary in the ordinary. In both [previous novel] The List of My Desires and The First Thing You See, he takes the everyday aspects of life and makes us see what is so special about things we often take for granted,” said publishing director Kirsty Dunsheath.</p> <p>“Scarlett Johansson looked exhausted. Her hair, somewhere in between two colours, was at war with itself, tumbling loose, flowing, as if in slow motion. Her luscious mouth had lost its usual gloss,” writes Delacourt early in the novel, in Anthea Bell’s English translation. “There were gloomy shadows beneath her eyes where her mascara had smudged, like charcoal. And unfortunately for Arthur Dreyfuss, she was wearing a baggy sweater. A sweater like a sack that did no justice to the actress’s curves, which everyone knew were bewitching, spellbinding.”</p> <p>Bell said that “from very early on it’s clear she is a lookalike”. “You won’t be in any doubt,” she added, praising the novel as “affecting”.</p> <p>Delacourt said the idea for the novel came to him after the publication of a survey in France which said that one out of two girls aged between 15 and 25 were considering cosmetic surgery. “So I asked myself, as an old advertiser, a young writer, and a father of a normal age, what we were doing to our children to stop them liking themselves as they were. And I suspected that appearances (fashion, models, actors) had become a more important model than what is inside,” he said. “So I imagined this encounter between one of the most beautiful girls in the world, and a boy who, like all boys, dreams of the most beautiful girl in the world. And when the surface cracks, we discover what is most important: real beauty is self-esteem.”</p> <p>Delacourt said that two lines had been removed from the book “at my request, because it seemed that they upset Ms Johansson”.</p> <p>He added: “However, all that is in the book concerning this actress is true and well-meant.”</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"French

'In real life, there are always more than two

award-winning books for children by accident –literally. More than a decade ago, she was working as a public defender in New York City and struggling to find traction with her writing. She loved adult fiction, but it wasn’t coming naturally. </p> <p>“I felt almost too slow, a little bit paralyzed when it came to trying to write that kind of material,” she said. “I couldn’t shed my self-consciousness.” She was reluctant to share her work, and even more reluctant to revise it.</p> <p>Then one day her toddler knocked her computer off the table, and all the stories she had been laboring over were permanently gone. “When I lost all of that, even though it was sad, it also felt like a release, in a way: it was a clean slate,” she said. “And then I asked myself what it was that I wanted from writing, and where my connection with books began, and the answer to that question was definitely in childhood, because that’s where my connection with reading began.” </p> <p>She decided to buy all the books she could remember reading as a child, as well as books that had been written for children since. “I just sort of tried to rediscover what it was that made me feel so strongly about books in the first place.”</p> <p>The most formative were the ones she read around age 11 or 12, on the border between childhood and puberty. “For me, that time was an awakening,” she said. “I began to see more complexity in the world around me, I began to have different kinds of thoughts, I began to form deeper friendships. I think that a lot of that was inspired by the books that I was reading. For the first time, really, I had access to the internal lives of other people. </p> <p>“They didn’t happen to be real people, because I was reading fiction, but the emotion was true,” she continued. “And so there was a way in which I was learning about myself by reading about the inner lives of people who didn’t exist. I think that’s one of the most important things that books do: not to teach you anything, but to help you teach yourself, by just being in the world of the book and having your own thoughts and reactions and noticing your own reactions and thoughts and learning about yourself that way.”</p> <p>It was hardly surprising, then, that Stead began to write books for and about children at that formative age. Her debut novel, First Light, was published in 2008, but it was 2009’s When You Reach Me, set in Manhattan in the late 70s, that launched her into the public eye: the novel was awarded the John Newbery Medal and received wide critical acclaim. She followed that two years later with Liar &amp; Spy, and her newest novel – published this month – Goodbye Stranger. </p> <p>Like much of Stead’s previous work, Goodbye Stranger is set in New York City, and it explores the often complicated dynamics of friendship as children enter adolescence. The novel alternates between three storylines, told in three different forms. A trio of seventh-grade girls struggle with burgeoning sexuality and the peer pressure that accompanies it; a boy writes to a grandfather who has betrayed the family; and an unnamed second-person narrator skips school on Valentine’s Day. Their stories weave together and connect in surprising ways, particularly as the identity of the unnamed narrator, who plays a minor role in the three girls’ story, begins to come into focus. </p> <p>Stead uses the word “echoes” to describe the way the conflicts play off of and reflect one another: all three storylines deal with a betrayal of some kind, and the way that old relationships bend – and sometimes break – with these betrayals. </p> <p>Stead said that she wanted to “stuff the book with relationships” of all kinds: friendship, romantic love, familial love and all the ways that grow with and apart from one another. At the heart of the story is the trio, who work to stick together as life actively pulls them apart. </p> <p>“I knew I wanted to write a story about three girls who really love each other, and are there for each other, even though they’re going through a year with a lot of changes, where they’re making different decisions – and people might disagree about which of those decisions were great and which of those decisions were less terrific.” </p> <p>In Goodbye Stranger, those decisions are often morally murky ones: issues of modern teenage life that could have easily slipped into sensationalism, but Stead handles them deftly. “What I really love in a book, what I want to give to my readers, is room to think, and room to have their own thoughts. That’s what I’m trying to create,” she said. </p> <p>“My books tend to have a lot of questions in them, and they tend to avoid black and white, for lack of a better metaphor. I think those kinds of decisions are not so interesting to think about. Either you’re sitting there saying, ‘Oh yeah, she did the right thing,’ or ‘Oh no, we all know that’s not the right thing.’ And it’s much more interesting to have a situation where people are doing all kinds of things, and maybe not everybody in a room of a hundred people would agree upon which were the obvious right things to do and which were the very obvious wrong things to do.”</p> <p>Stead trusts her readers to be able to dig into that moral complexity. “I do try to write in ways that reflect reality,” she says, “and I think that reality is rarely simple. And often there aren’t two choices.” She mentions the ongoing riddle in the book, about two brothers standing in front of the door to heaven and the door to hell, and one character’s response: “People act like riddles are hard, but real life is harder. In real life, there are always more than two doors.” </p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"The children’s author talks about how writing was cathartic to her as a pre-teen and how her new novel Goodbye Stranger is full of ‘murky morals’","headline":"Rebecca Stead: 'In real life, there are always more than two doors'","byline":"Elizabeth Minkel","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440601822442/08053851-35ec-4173-a772-58ecf92a6b6a-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-08-30T11:15:00-04:00","standfirst":"<p>The children’s author talks about how writing was cathartic to her as a pre-teen and how her new novel Goodbye Stranger is full of ‘murky morals’</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/27/rebecca-stead-always-more-than-two-doors","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/aug/27/rebecca-stead-always-more-than-two-doors","sectionName":"Books","tags":[{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","webTitle":"Children and teenagers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/elizabeth-minkel","webTitle":"Elizabeth Minkel","r2ContributorId":"70078","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433261362070/_Elizabeth-Minkel.jpg","firstName":"elizabeth","lastName":"minkel","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Elizabeth Minkel writes a column about fan culture for the New Statesman and is a staff writer at the Millions.

But it has also caused controversy, with Madrid academic David Felipe Arranz describing it as “a crime against literature” to the AFP last week, adding: “I ask the booksellers in Madrid and they tell me no one buys Cervantes’ original novel anymore because readers prefer the ‘light’ version … you cannot twist the flavour of the words of the greatest writer in our language.”</p> <p>“Nothing upsets Spain more than people – often, its own people – meddling with Don Quixote,” admitted Stavans, the Lewis-Sebring professor in Latin American and Latino culture at Amherst College in the US. But Stavans pointed out that Trapiello’s adaptation of the novel follows the bestselling author <a href=\"http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2319878/0/arturo-perez-reverte/nuevo-edicion-quijote/rae-libro-academico/\">Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s abbreviated edition</a> from the Real Academia Espanola last year, and said it was a necessary development.</p> <p>“Why did the RAE embark on it? Because if it doesn’t do something about people not reading Don Quixote, the institution itself will become irrelevant,” he said. “As a result of a number of factors, including school curriculum changes, young people in Spain aren’t reading. The thermometer is Don Quixote and it has been abandoned … My own impression … is that nine out of every 10 people who read Cervantes’s novel today are outside Spain. And a large portion of those readers access it in translation.”</p> <p>Stavans, who has written the introduction to a forthcoming new edition of Don Quixote in English for Restless Books, as well as the forthcoming Quixote: The Novel and the World, said that while it “isn’t true that Spanish readers can’t understand Cervantes’s language”, with the language ageing less than English over the last 400 years, “by which I mean that Shakespeare is harder to understand today than his contemporary Cervantes”, a new version was still required.</p> <p>“Was there a need for a modern translation, then? Of course there was. Shakespeare is updated, adapted, modernised, and otherwise rewritten all the time and nobody makes a fuss. Those approaches, in my eyes, are a tribute, a celebration, an acknowledgment of the enormous debt we owe him,” said the scholar, drawing parallels between the situation in Spain and the uproar that greeted an Alabama publisher’s excision of the word “nigger” from Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.</p> <p>“Its rationale was that in the States young African Americans weren’t reading the book because it is offensive to modern sensibilities. Intellectuals and the media vilified the effort. The publisher responded rather intelligently by saying that the project wasn’t about censoring Mark Twain’s novel but about making it more available,” said Stavans. “That, I think, is what Andrés Trapiello is doing.”</p> <p>Trapiello’s edition is introduced by Nobel literature laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, who writes that the new version “rejuvenates” Cervantes’ novel, while allowing it to remain itself. Many readers, said Llosa, are discouraged from reading Don Quixote from beginning to end because of the “antique vocabulary” and the scholarly footnotes. But after enjoying Trapiello’s version, he adds, they might feel encouraged to tackle the original text.</p> <p>With Don Quixote translated into 145 languages today – Restless Books’ new edition, which marks 400 years since the second volume was published, uses John Ormsby’s version – Trapiello <a href=\"http://www.afp.com/en/news/quixote-crazy-rewriting-spains-comic-bible\">told the AFP</a> that it was a “paradox” that foreign readers could enjoy the novel “without any problems” in translation, “but Spanish-speaking readers can’t understand half of it unless they read it with notes”.</p> <p>“There are a great many people who have not read it or who have given it up several times because it is so hard,” he told the agency. “They are obliged to read it in language that is not understood nowadays. They make you read it at school and lots of people have bad memories of that.”</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Andrés Trapiello’s modern-language version of Miguel de Cervantes’ classic is ‘necessary’ says expert, as Spanish academics rebel","headline":"Modern version of Don Quixote declared 'crime against literature'","byline":"Alison Flood","commentable":"true"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/19/modern-version-of-don-quixote-declared-against-literature","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/aug/19/modern-version-of-don-quixote-declared-against-literature","sectionName":"Books","tags":[{"id":"books/miguelcervantes","webTitle":"Miguel de Cervantes","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/miguelcervantes","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/miguelcervantes","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/spain","webTitle":"Spain","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/spain","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"flood","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of the Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]}]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2015/aug/19/why-keep-books-give-them-away","elements":[{"id":"213ca48f6813754e61c90de266a9933c3d78b6cb","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/17/1439829562288/Book-collection---time-fo-005.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Alamy","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/17/1439829562288/Book-collection---time-fo-005.jpg","source":"Alamy","photographer":"Rob Whitworth / Alamy","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Book collection … time for Oxfam?

the book is, at times, very upsetting, it is ultimately uplifting and life-affirming’</p>","body":"<p>The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky is narrated by Charlie, the titular ‘wallflower’, in a series of letters that he writes to a stranger, beginning the night before he starts his freshman year of high school in 1991. These letters catalogue Charlie’s attempts to “participate”, as he wanders wide eyed through a series of house parties and Rocky Horror Picture Show productions with his new, older friends. Along the way, Chbosky intelligently explores stock YA themes such as mental health, substance abuse and sexuality, whilst simultaneously reminding the reader about how exciting it is to be young and idealistic. </p> <p>What makes Chbosky’s stream of consciousness style more beautiful than that used in Suicidal Tendencies’ hardcore punk song “Institutionalised”, for example, is the lyrical, philosophical nature of the prose. At one point, Charlie starts going to the mall simply to try and figure out why people go there. He see “Old men sitting alone. Young girls with blue eye shadow and awkward jaws. Little kids who look tired.” “It all felt very unsettling” to him. The writing here is so rhythmic that it’s almost hypnotic. I love the control that Chbosky exercises: he demonstrates Charlie’s deteriorating mental health to the reader simply by having him see sadness wherever he goes. Beyond the writing style, there is still a lot to like about the novel. The cast of characters is diverse. The female characters are numerous and as well developed as their male counterparts. Chbosky’s approach is always unflinching, even when the content is upsetting. Underpinning everything is a desire to acknowledge the complexities in other people, an understanding that nobody does bad stuff because they are innately bad. In this way, although the book is, at times, very upsetting, it is ultimately uplifting and life-affirming. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e3632b92136013758a4935e1c7dfcdbd98ef9ffc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/4/1438684333250/76656e7f-eefd-43ab-9c64-349429ae9f37-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" width=\"262\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Maybe I’m just being sentimental, but it is actually difficult for me to find anything that I don’t like about The Perks of Being a Wallflower. My one criticism is that whilst Chbosky does include a gay character, that gay character is male. Humour me, dear reader, allow me one tangential rant. Can anyone think of a single YA book that isn’t explicitly about LGBTQ+ issues, that contains a lesbian character whose sexuality (like Patrick’s) is part of the narrative without being integral to the plot? I can’t. Culturally, we seem quite comfortable with the idea of a slightly effeminate, flamboyant, gay character and I guess I would have liked to see Chbosky be more original in this regard. However this gripe is not as much with Perks as with the YA genre as a whole. I do not expect every book to have an obligatory lesbian extra, but a sprinkling across the lot would be refreshing. On the whole, I think that Chbosky’s discussion of sexuality is excellent and very interesting. For example, Charlie used to kiss boys in the neighbourhood when he was little and is very aware that this concerned his father. Similarly, Charlie’s grandfather doesn’t like to hug family members – especially the boys. The contrast between the older generations’ fear of homosexuality and Charlie’s acceptance of Patrick is indicative of the way that society’s response to homosexuality was changing in the 1990s. It also has a kind of didactic purpose in showing the reader that it’s ok to be gay, which I think is particularly important in YA fiction. </p> <p>However, I also ought to mention that sexual abuse and suicide feature quite heavily in The Perks of Being a Wallflower and it would therefore be irresponsible of me to recommend it without a trigger warning. Furthermore, it is probably worth pointing out to parents who are inclined to censorship that this book does contain some additional (really quite exciting) drugs/sex/swearing content that would make the text unsuitable for younger readers. </p> <p>With this in mind though, I cannot recommend The Perks of Being A Wallflower highly enough. In general, literature allows us to live other people’s lives through their stories. We can discover what it is like to be a different gender or age, to live in a different place or time with different values. In this way, reading is a remarkable feat of empathy. But occasionally we find a fictional scenario which in some way matches our own circumstances so profoundly that there is no need for empathy. When I first read The Perks of Being A Wallflower, I was Charlie. Although our backgrounds were in some ways different, I had never, and have never since, read a textual representation of adolescence that matched my own experiences so well. This is the strength of Chbosky’s writing. He crafts Charlie’s voice in a way that defies context. Charlie is inside every lonely teenager and every adult remembers him fondly. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a gift, and to Stephan Chbosky I will always be grateful. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/perks-of-being-a-wallflower-4.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong><br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read?<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\"> Join the site </a>and send us your review!</strong></p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>Nic: </strong>‘Although the book is, at times, very upsetting, it is ultimately uplifting and life-affirming’","headline":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky – review","byline":"Nic"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/07/the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-stephen-chbosky-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/07/the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-stephen-chbosky-review","sectionName":"Children's books","tags":[{"id":"childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","webTitle":"Children's books","type":"blog","sectionId":"childrens-books-site","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","sectionName":"Children's books","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","webTitle":"Children and teenagers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/teen-books","webTitle":"Teen books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/teen-books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/teen-books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/friendship","webTitle":"Friendship (children and teens)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/friendship","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/friendship","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/teen-romance","webTitle":"Teen romance (childrens and teens)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/teen-romance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/teen-romance","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/school","webTitle":"School","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/school","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/school","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/childrens-user-reviews","webTitle":"Children's user reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/childrens-user-reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/childrens-user-reviews","references":[]}]},{"id":"books/2015/aug/19/top-10-conservative-novels","elements":[{"id":"9f252d1eb7a9eeb8f06cf08b5024946a0d56f6e7","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/9f252d1eb7a9eeb8f06cf08b5024946a0d56f6e7/41_1169_1940_1166/1000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2007 Rex Features.

Old-fashioned Tory fiction fascinates me, partly because it’s social anthropology, with authors and characters from a different world. The techniques and skills in the splendid writing in these novels are also under-appreciated. </p> <p>John Buchan, <a href=\"http://www.abfar.org.uk/ref/?Author_notes_and_lists:Dornford_Yates\">Dornford Yates</a> and <a href=\"http://www.angelathirkell.org/\">Angela Thirkell</a> are three of the best in this genre, and were phenomenally influential. Buchan was a Conservative Unionist MP for eight years (among many other things). His most famous character, Richard Hannay, is an unreconstructed Rhodesian imperialist, but should be read alongside Buchan’s other heroes in a cast of Conservative politicians and adventurers. Yates staunchly opposed social change in his sparkling social comedies and brilliant thrillers. Thirkell reinvented Trollope’s Barsetshire in 30 novels, making a complex saga of intermarrying county families who laughed at liberals and sneered at socialists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2015/aug/14/john-buchan-thirty-nine-steps-podcast\">On the trail of John Buchan's Thirty-Nine Steps – books podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They represent the political and social perspectives that the writers of the left were resisting, from the 1920s to well past the second world war. Yet writers like these are hardly studied or taught. Ignoring fiction of a political colour that you don’t agree with is teaching with blinkers on. Literary history should function as a 360-degree panopticon. </p> <p>It’s also important when reading these novelists to understand how endemic antisemitism and racism was in British literary culture, before the Holocaust and afterwards. No writer of the period was exempt from this, even if it doesn’t always appear in their collected works: read the letters and diaries of TS Eliot and Virginia Woolf to see some startling examples. It’s not good enough just to squeal in outrage at the notorious cases. By reading more widely, we can identify the writers who really relished writing vilely about Jews and Africans, and how often they did it. This doesn’t excuse those who used racist or antisemitic words as a casual echo of their own times, but it will help to put their words in context: as historical usage, not necessarily a malignant choice. </p> <p>I’ve picked my favourite novels from these writers, and from seven other wonderful novelists of the right, but nothing published after the 1960s. I cannot enjoy reading fiction written from Thatcherite conservatism, or set in the greedy and selfish society that her values promoted. </p> <h2><strong>1. <a href=\"http://www.victoriansecrets.co.uk/catalogue/the-good-comrade-by-una-silberrad/\">The Good Comrade</a></strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.victoriansecrets.co.uk/catalogue/the-good-comrade-by-una-silberrad/\"> (1907) by Una L Silberrad</a></strong></h2> <p>Julia Polkington goes to work in Holland as a cook so she can steal a valuable blue tulip bulb and repay her father’s debts. After deciding she can’t do this to her gentle employers, she decides to complete a British spying mission instead, by stealing the formula for a secret explosive, taking a sample home to London hidden in her hat. </p> <p>How can anyone resist this spectacularly inventive spy novel? It’s packed with doughty British patriotism, disdain for the shallow snobberies of the Edwardian middle classes, and is a powerfully realistic love story.</p> <h2><strong>2. <a href=\"http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0301341h.html\">Castle Gay</a></strong><strong><a href=\"http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0301341h.html\"> (1930) by John Buchan</a></strong></h2> <p>A reclusive and pompous newspaper magnate is mistakenly kidnapped and abandoned in a Borders cottage, then returned to civilisation by means of a hillwalking boot-camp and a by-election, to discover he is the target of a political plot.</p> <p>Probably my favourite Buchan novel, this is a romp through the heather, an idyllic walking tour and a masterclass in disguises on the hoof. Buchan’s appreciation for political debate ranges from the hustings to fierce pub arguments, and the default position is always Conservative.</p> <h2><strong>3. <a href=\"http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/19th-september-1931/26/adele-and-co-by-dornford-yates-hodder-and-stough--\">Adèle and Co</a></strong><strong><a href=\"http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/19th-september-1931/26/adele-and-co-by-dornford-yates-hodder-and-stough--\"> (1931) by Dornford Yates</a></strong></h2> <p>The elegant, witty, masterful Pleydell family of White Ladies in Hampshire have their jewels stolen in Paris. Knowing that the French police are simply useless, they set out to detect and recover Daphne’s emerald bracelets and Adèle’s pearls themselves. </p> <p>The best introduction to all of Dornford Yates’s specialities: the thriller, the riotously funny comedy of the upper classes, and the novel of high-speed car chases. Beware of the high-octane snobbery, but it’s brilliantly written.</p> <h2><strong>4. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/gaudy-night.html\">Gaudy Night</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/gaudy-night.html\"> (1935) by Dorothy L Sayers</a></strong></h2> <p>Sayers’ unquestioning acceptance of the social hierarchy, and her passion for Lord Peter Wimsey’s background and social assumptions make her a conservative novelist. Gaudy Night, a great feminist novel, also advocates the conservative status quo. The servants’ loyalty to the college is a metaphor for loyalty to a feudal society, even if the dons wear frocks. And order (it is a detective novel, underneath the romance) must be restored: the most conservative impulse of all.</p> <h2><strong>5. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/call-of-cthulu-and-other-weird-tales.html\">The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Tales</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/call-of-cthulu-and-other-weird-tales.html\"> (written up to 1937: this collection published 2011) by HP Lovecraft</a></strong></h2> <p>I am very fond of the weird, especially baroque fantasies from a frothingly reactionary writer like Lovecraft. Frustration and anger breed the best invention, and these visions of a tentacled overlord from under the sea in a different dimension makes so much sense as a metaphor for conservative fears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c705daf7a3ddc9440c448ff7740c4026d72a7a48\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/19/1439974917542/09187b7e-2fa8-4cfb-b63b-ec7e737497ac-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nancy Mitford.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Right but not wrong ...

Southbridge prep school has to find room for an evacuated city school and the incoming headmaster, who is worried about “this new and peculiar world where no one knew what dialectic meant”.</p> <p>Thirkell’s eye for social detail and her unexpected sympathies for otherwise repellent characters make this superb novel of the Home Front a beautifully rounded classic of social history and political commentary.</p> <h2><strong><em>7. </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/brideshead-revisited-5.html\">Brideshead Revisited</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/brideshead-revisited-5.html\"> (1945) by Evelyn Waugh</a></strong></h2> <p>I’m sorry if this is a predictable choice, but Waugh is the most wonderful Tory writer, and this novel is a glorious elegy for the conservative life he could see disappearing after the second world war. It’s his most readable novel, and such a marvellous evocation of a vanishing prewar life of privilege. Waugh borrowed Thirkell’s obnoxious Captain Hooper from her novel Growing Up (1943) and put him in this novel to represent the ghastly new egalitarian world. </p> <h2><strong>8. <a href=\"https://reading19001950.wordpress.com/2014/10/22/tory-heaven-or-thunder-on-the-right-by-marghanita-laski-1948/\">Tory Heaven</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://reading19001950.wordpress.com/2014/10/22/tory-heaven-or-thunder-on-the-right-by-marghanita-laski-1948/\"> (1948) by Marghanita Laski</a></strong></h2> <p>“He would sit on a bollard on the meagre allotment of third-class deck in the stern, and stare above him to the Socialist Governor-General … I suppose that chap use to read H G Wells as a lad, he thought resentfully, and think about a Socialist Utopia as a sort of dream that could never come off. And now it’s come off.”</p> <p>Such a clever satire on the miseries of the unhappy Conservatives in postwar Socialist Britain.</p> <h2><strong><em>9. </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/blessing-2.html\">The Blessing</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/blessing-2.html\"> (1951) by Nancy Mitford</a></strong></h2> <p>“‘Honestly now, which would you prefer as a grandmother – a clever old Jewess who has brought brain and money and Caffieri commodes into the family, or some ass of an actress?’</p> <p>‘I can’t understand you, Grace, you used to seem so very English at home.’”</p> <p>Aristocratic English rose marries aristocratic French count, and two inimical forms of class conservatism and snob values collide, helped to near disaster by their demon son. </p> <h2><strong>10. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dr-no.html\">Dr No</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dr-no.html\"> (1958) by Ian Fleming</a></strong></h2> <p>The<strong> </strong>first appearance of James Bond, in all his consumerist playboy majesty. The violence is suggested and dangled, never obtrusive, and the instructions for seduction are detailed and terribly exclusive. But the black man gets killed, the villain isn’t white, and the pretty girl has to join the colonising classes to get on in life.</p> <ul> <li><a

news that city council has ‘paused’ purchase of new books, professional body CILIP appeals for properly resourced facility to be maintained</p>","body":"<p>The chief executive of librarians’ association CILIP has written to the head of Birmingham city council to lay out his “concerns about the ongoing quality of library services available” in the city, following the revelation that some libraries in Birmingham were asking the public to donate new books.</p> <p>After a flyer from a Birmingham library began circulating online last week, claiming that “due to public saving cuts we are no longer purchasing any new books or newspapers. Therefore we are looking for any books that have been published in the last 12 months to be donated to the library”, Birmingham city councillor Penny Holbrook confirmed a “pause on the book fund”. </p> <p>She added: “We need to make huge savings across the council … whilst we have not corporately asked for donations from the public and this is the action of a few libraries, we do of course welcome any support the public wish to give our community libraries and the council in general. However, we do not expect the public to make up for cuts to the budget from the government.”</p> <p>With authors condemning the situation – “However Bham Council spin it, spending £180m on a new library building then finding you can’t afford to buy any new books is beyond terrible … austerity enters its latest phase,” wrote Jonathan Coe on Twitter, referring to the 2013 opening of the £188.8m Library of Birmingham – CILIP has now written an open letter to the council’s chief executive Mark Rogers.</p> <p>“We have concerns about the ongoing quality of library services available to the communities and citizens of Birmingham,” writes the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals’ chief executive Nick Poole. </p> <p>Poole urges the council “to carefully consider the impact of budget cuts on library services and how in turn communities and the local economy will be affected”, recommending that it maintains “as much professional expertise in the library service as possible so that Birmingham’s libraries continue to innovate and meet the changing needs of the city”.</p> <p>Offering to meet Rogers’ team, Poole writes that while “I understand that Birmingham city council has to make significant savings … properly resourced and staffed library services” need to be “part of the solution”.</p> <p>Rogers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MKMRogers/status/632291279213330432?lang=en\">wrote on Twitter</a> that he “ welcome[s] the letter”, that the reply is “in the post”, and that he will work with CILIP. CILIP said on Tuesday that Poole had yet to hear back, but that “we expect to and look forward to following up with him and his team”.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"After news that city council has ‘paused’ purchase of new books, professional body CILIP appeals for properly resourced facility to be maintained","headline":"Librarians call on Birmingham to maintain library services","byline":"Alison Flood","commentable":"true"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/18/librarians-call-on-birmingham-to-maintain-library-services","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/aug/18/librarians-call-on-birmingham-to-maintain-library-services","sectionName":"Books","tags":[{"id":"books/libraries","webTitle":"Libraries","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/libraries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/libraries","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"uk/birmingham","webTitle":"Birmingham","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/birmingham","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/society","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","webTitle":"Alison Flood","r2ContributorId":"27440","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"flood","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of the Bookseller</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[]}]},{"id":"film/2015/aug/18/james-mcavoy-daniel-radcliffe-trailer-victor-frankenstein","elements":[{"id":"1547e874dd6a443e89937089337548b7f94841fa","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/18/1439904707868/1ce188a4-e328-4ed8-851d-5810c5ea9388-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/18/1439904707868/1ce188a4-e328-4ed8-851d-5810c5ea9388-220x132.jpeg","source":"PR","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Youngish Frankenstein ...

Broken Stars was an irresistible love story and a wonderful escape’</p>","body":"<p>Although I began this book with some doubts, after trying (and failing) to read it previously, I was soon enamoured with the world of Amie Kaufman and Meagan Spooner’s creation, or should I say, the worlds. I must admit, I’m not typically a sci-fi lover, but the action-packed plot and the vividness of this space-adventure universe intrigued me nevertheless. Although it was not the most unique text I’ve ever laid eyes upon, These Broken Stars was an irresistible love story and a wonderful escape for a while.</p> <p>The book is about Lilac LaRoux, top of the top in space social class and making her first independent journey across the universe on her father’s star ship, the Icarus, and Tarver Merendsen, a decorated soldier who has no business speaking to, or even making eye contact with, anyone of Lilac’s status. When an unforeseen disaster leaves them stranded on a rogue planet with nobody but each other for company, the only way to survive the less than ideal circumstances might just be to overcome their differences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1a647ac56cc8c4d450e2b2a33cd7c40bced2bb95\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/3/1438617591216/8c332d81-bb12-4597-a3f6-2167b0bdd6b2-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"These Broken Stars\" width=\"262\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One thing which I really liked about this book was the wonderful character development. I felt that the fact that there were two authors really assisted with this as each of the two main protagonists had their own individual voice and personality. Despite having seen books wherein the two author format has combined to create something maybe more spectacular than this book, I felt that it worked relatively well and assisted in the creation of loveable and believable characters. When I began the book, I was nervous about the fact that for the majority of it, there were literally only two characters interacting. However, this actually made reading These Broken Stars even more memorable and was not for one moment boring.<br /></p> <p>I do have one issue with the book, although it might occur only to me since I am not particularly familiar with science fiction, and that is the confusing terminology used, specifically towards the end of the text. There was a tendency in this book to have long and confusing paragraphs about scientific and electrical systems, which I think the authors may have made up as part of their vivid universe, but which just ended up muddling my mind. In fact, in the end, I started to skip over them with my eyes and find the next, comprehensible section of the text.<br /></p> <p>Despite this, I really enjoyed These Broken Stars, and will probably venture on to the next book in the series, as the ending really left me wanting more. I thought the format of the book was extremely unique and intriguing, and I was especially captivated by the wonderful characters, whom I hope to see more of. I would thoroughly recommend this book to lovers of a once-in-a-while soppy love story, and also to those who like science fiction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/these-broken-stars-2.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong><br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read?<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\"> Join the site </a>and send us your review!</strong></p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>ellaclaire:</strong> ‘These Broken Stars was an irresistible love story and a wonderful escape’","headline":"These Broken Stars by Amie Kaufman and Meagan Spooner – review","byline":"ellaclaire"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/07/these-broken-stars-amie-kaufman-meagan-spooner-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/07/these-broken-stars-amie-kaufman-meagan-spooner-review","sectionName":"Children's books","tags":[{"id":"childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","webTitle":"Children's books","type":"blog","sectionId":"childrens-books-site","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","sectionName":"Children's books","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","webTitle":"Children and teenagers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/teen-books","webTitle":"Teen books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/teen-books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/teen-books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/teen-romance","webTitle":"Teen romance (childrens and teens)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/teen-romance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/teen-romance","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/adventure","webTitle":"Adventure (children and teens)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/adventure","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/adventure","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/childrens-sci-fi","webTitle":"Sci-fi (children and teens)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-sci-fi","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/childrens-sci-fi","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/childrens-user-reviews","webTitle":"Children's user reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/childrens-user-reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/childrens-user-reviews","references":[]}]},{"id":"books/2015/aug/18/elton-john-protests-venice-ban-on-gay-childrens-books","elements":[{"id":"f7406f13c3f1389c455e56b7ab3f4798aec39cb2","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f7406f13c3f1389c455e56b7ab3f4798aec39cb2/0_129_2045_1226/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"2015 Tim Mosenfelder","displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7406f13c3f1389c455e56b7ab3f4798aec39cb2/0_129_2045_1226/2000.jpg","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Tim Mosenfelder","imageType":"Photograph","altText":" Elton John performs last week at the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.","suppliersReference":"483533544","height":"1199","credit":"Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images","caption":"‘Families are about love’ ...

Following outrage from authors and the book trade – more than 250 Italian authors asked for their books to be withdrawn from Venice in solidarity – the initial list of 49 banned books was reduced to two, <a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TGNp83MPnEA/VQ1x551GCyI/AAAAAAAAYis/7611T05adZA/s1600/piccolouovocop.JPG\">Francesca Pardi’s Piccolo Uovo</a> (Little Egg), and <a href=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81V5hiExRVL.jpg\">Ophélie Texier’s Jean a deux mamans</a> (Jean Has Two Mummies).</p> <p>Both relate to homosexuality, <a href=\"http://www.pen-international.org/centresnews/italian-pen-on-the-banning-of-childrens-books-in-italy/\">said Italian PEN</a>, which condemned their ban. The first book is about an egg that doesn’t want to be born because it doesn’t know what sort of family it will have, so explores all different kinds of family; the second about a young wolf with two mothers.</p> <p>Now John has added his voice to protests, with a<a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/6XIQUNgGQ9/\"> post on his Instagram page</a> highlighting “one of the Furnish-John family’s favourite storybooks”, Todd Parr’s The Family Book. “It champions an all-inclusive world where families come in all shapes, sizes and colours. And most importantly, that families are about love. Our boys adore it,” wrote the singer. </p> <p>“And in the opposing corner we have Luigi Brugnaro, the extremely silly looking mayor of Venice. He’s stupidly chosen to politicise children’s books by banning titles that touch on same-sex families living happily ever after. So instead of encouraging a world based on inclusiveness, tolerance and love, he’s championing a future society that’s divisive and fosters ignorance. Beautiful Venice is indeed sinking, but not as fast as the boorishly bigoted Brugnaro.”</p> <p>In July, Brugnaro had said that the previous administration in Venice had introduced its “personal view of society” into schools via the books, criticising the lack of consultation with parents, who he said “must have a say on the crucial issues that affect the education of their children”.</p> <p>On Twitter this week, he has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LuigiBrugnaro\">retweeting support </a>in the wake of John’s criticism. This morning, he also wrote: “In Venice, we definitely won’t risk creating sexual confusion for those under three. We respect children’s growth”, adding, “absolute respect for the choices of homosexuals … the children have nothing to do with it”.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Singer condemns ‘boorishly bigoted’ city mayor Luigi Brugnaro for removing picture books about same-sex families from

Coriander is a little girl who lived with her mother (a magical fairy). She thinks that everything in the world is sweet and splendid, and that everything will go her way, until her mother dies. Her life is suddenly turned upside down, and her world revolves around sadness and despair. Magical fairies and castles step in and change her life along with mysteries and wishes. The only thing that is left is hope. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"540b50b89f51031648539ed58bbb3180ce3fdded\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/4/1438681923094/83a4a219-a16d-4dae-a3f0-10a12dca748d-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"I, Coriander\" width=\"269\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Read all about how Coriander embarks on a great adventure bringing back everything she loves.

Will she get back the things which are most important to her? </p> <p>Read all about Coriander’s life-changing story and find out more about old London history during the English Civil War and the reign of Oliver Cromwell. This is a splendid tale full of splendid twists. I got hooked on it from the first sentence to the last. This is a must read.
