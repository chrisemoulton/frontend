While some of the shows have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/04/classicalmusicandopera-jsbach\">designed for touring</a>, the latest, Objects at an Exhibition, was site specific. In collaboration with NMC Records, the orchestra had commissioned six composers to write pieces suggested by exhibits in the <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/\">Science Museum</a> in South Kensington; the results were then given their first performances in situ, as close as possible to the objects that inspired them, in an evening-long event devised by director Tim Hopkins.</p><p>The oldest composer represented is in her 80s, and the youngest in his mid-30s, so the stylistic range was vast. <a href=\"http://www.theamusgrave.com/\">Thea Musgrave</a>’s rather French, rather neoclassical Power Play, conducted by Nicholas Collon among the engines and turbines of the museum’s Energy Hall, was worlds away from <a href=\"http://www.christophermayo.net/\">Christopher Mayo</a>’s Supermarine, inspired by the slate statue of the engineer R J Mitchell in the flight gallery, with cello and double bass punctuating its aero-engine samples. It contrasted, too, with <a href=\"http://www.claudiamolitor.org/\">Claudia Molitor</a>’s rather engaging 2TwoLO, that harks back to the earliest days of radio in the UK, when broadcasting music was forbidden on the fledgling station 2LO, and imagines a way of smuggling a performance (of Handel’s famous Largo) into this music-free zone.<br

The King’s captivation by her was to change the political and religious landscape of England forever. Reformation was brewing, and Henry wanted a son. For Anne, he was willing to divorce his first queen of 24 years, break with Rome and make himself Head of the Church in England, as well as destroy those near and dear to him who dared to stand in his way. But, having achieved his ambitions, and after only three years of marriage, Henry VIII had Anne executed on multiple charges of adultery, including, among the five accused, her brother George Viscount Rochford and lutenist <a href=\"http://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/bios/mark-smeaton/\">Mark Smeaton</a>. Was she guilty? After centuries of debate the jury is still out, and we probably will never know. </p><p>Anne is thought to have been born in the early years of the 16th century, not in her family home at <a href=\"http://www.hevercastle.co.uk/\">Hever Castle</a> as many assume, but in Norfolk, probably in Blickling. In the spring of 1513 she became a maid in honour in the household of <a href=\"http://thefreelancehistorywriter.com/2013/06/28/margaret-of-austria-duchess-of-savoy-and-regent-of-the-netherlands/\">Margaret of Austria</a> (daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I), who was famous for her <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8vJu8gykYUEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Margaret+of+Austria+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=loPr1SHwvr&amp;sig=uTV9RpTyocTFByqmYCph4qRfhJE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwCWoVChMI-I2C5IzvxwIVwW0UCh0c2AsR#v=onepage&amp;q=Margaret%20of%20Austria%20music&amp;f=false\">patronage of musicians</a> and who possessed many important music books. In the following year Anne’s ambitious father arranged her transfer to the French court where she attended Henry VIII’s sister Mary, who was to marry Louis XII. She later served under Mary’s stepdaughter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_of_France\">Queen Claude</a>, with whom she stayed until she was called home to England early in 1522. </p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-10-05T15:41:29.663+01:00","standfirst":"<p>A Tudor songbook with the inscription <em>Mistres ABolleyne nowe thus </em>is believed to have belonged to Anne Boleyn.

riffs that can give you heart palpitations. An extreme strain of heavy metal, it first emerged in the mid-80s with bands such as Bathory, Sarc&oacute;fago and Master’s Hammer, then achieved grim infamy in 90s Norway with the antisocial likes of Mayhem, Burzum and Emperor. Despite spreading among the global underground since, this barbaric image has rather stuck.</p><p>Enter “blackgaze”, the buzz term for a new school of bands taking black metal out of the shadows and melding its blast beats, dungeon wailing and razorwire guitars with the more reflective melodies of post-rock, shoegaze and post-hardcore. It’s a geographically loose scene and its bands have been embraced by the indie media, which means you’re now as likely to hear black metal at ATP as in the Carpathian mountains.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-10-05T09:28:23.320+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Once marginalised for being extreme, bands such as Deafheaven are fusing black metal with

In collaboration with NMC Records, the orchestra had commissioned six composers to write pieces suggested by exhibits in the <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/\">Science Museum</a> in South Kensington; the results were then given their first performances in situ, as close as possible to the objects that inspired them, in an evening-long event devised by director Tim Hopkins.</p><p>The oldest composer represented is in her 80s, and the youngest in his mid-30s, so the stylistic range was vast. <a href=\"http://www.theamusgrave.com/\">Thea Musgrave</a>’s rather French, rather neoclassical Power Play, conducted by Nicholas Collon among the engines and turbines of the museum’s Energy Hall, was worlds away from <a href=\"http://www.christophermayo.net/\">Christopher Mayo</a>’s Supermarine, inspired by the slate statue of the engineer R J Mitchell in the flight gallery, with cello and double bass punctuating its aero-engine samples. It contrasted, too, with <a href=\"http://www.claudiamolitor.org/\">Claudia Molitor</a>’s rather engaging 2TwoLO, that harks back to the earliest days of radio in the UK, when broadcasting music was forbidden on the fledgling station 2LO, and imagines a way of smuggling a performance (of Handel’s famous Largo) into this music-free zone.<br

missing: the village boozer Schmidt – ably sung by Jeff Stewart – loses his drinking companion Johann, many of whose lines are transferred to Michael Druiett’s solidly respectable Bailiff, who thereby gains an unexpected fondness for the bottle.</p><p>The small group of the Bailiff’s young children, though, remains; at the Britten theatre the perfectly rehearsed team comes from <a

lyricism in season opener","body":"<p>Under principal conductor Thomas S&oslash;nderg&aring;rd, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/bbc-national-orchestra-of-wales\">BBC National Orchestra of Wales</a> opened their new season with a showcase affair, beginning with a glittering display of Stravinsky’s Fireworks. Because this was the work in which the young Igor was flexing his wings for his early masterpiece The Firebird, it also read as an introductory compliment to the orchestra’s new composer-in-association, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.schott-music.com/shop/persons/az/huw-watkins/works/?cwl_sort=title&amp;page=1%20or%20http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02r7216\">Huw Watkins</a>, whose first big successes came in his 20s.</p><p>Watkins’s London Concerto was written 10 years ago when he was 29, and was commissioned for the centenary of the London Symphony Orchestra as a vehicle for three of that orchestra’s brilliant principals. It is testimony to the remarkable assurance and fluency of Watkins’s writing from the outset of his career. His use of three solo instruments, violin, bassoon and harp invokes the concerto grosso and the sinfonia concertante, and, with the second and fourth of the work’s five movements set for orchestra alone, there is a definite sense of Watkins playing deftly with form. It was the balance of chamber-music intimacy and lyricism – in the solo instruments, played with flair by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://malinbroman.com/\">Malin Broman</a>, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://lso.co.uk/orchestra/99-players?start=1\">Rachel Gough</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.hannahstone.co.uk/\">Hannah Stone</a>, respectively, and in their interaction with the orchestral soloists – with a larger-scale overall momentum that was striking here. The ending, a gentle fizzling out, allowed it to avoid the obvious.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-10-05T09:54:02.813+01:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>St David’s Hall,

unprecedented level of popularity for a contemporary classical composer. The CD went on to sell more than 1m copies. The BBC’s day-long <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/rgmxn3\">Total Immersion event</a>, however, left out the Polish artist’s most famous piece while exploring other aspects of his output.</p><p>Given by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under the authoritative baton of <a href=\"http://www.icartists.co.uk/artists/antoni-wit\">Antoni Wit</a>, the evening concert featured the UK premiere of one of the relatively few works G&oacute;recki composed after finding worldwide fame: a Kyrie left incomplete on his death in 2010, its final touches added by his son, Mikołaj. The result represents the best and worst of an uneven creative figure. With its rampant percussion, the orchestral opening aims for drama, but ends up being merely histrionic; however, some of the choral writing – flawlessly executed by the BBC Symphony Chorus – proved magical.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-10-05T00:00:40.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>St Giles’ Gripplegate, London<br></strong>The BBC Symphony Orchestra’s evening

my favourites since. It has all that well-smoked wisdom, that mingling of strength and yearning that seems to charge the work of all my favourite female artists – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/08/end-of-the-road-festival-women-acts\">Laura Marling</a>, The Weather Station, Sharon Van Etten and Tift Merritt, to name but four. Reid is just 23, and since I am loathe to run that “old beyond her years” line, let us simply say that when I hear a young artist making an album as soulful and rich and self-possessed as Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs, I feel so thrilled not only for the existence of that record but for all the music they will make over all the years to come.<br

Have a look, and if your curiosity is piqued, do go and see her on tour throughout October (she was terrific at End of the Road the other week). <a href=\"http://www.janeweavermusic.com/tour/\">You can get the full list of dates here</a>.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-09-29T11:22:38.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The spacerocking Guardian Music favourite is back with a new single.

In the wake of his signing a publishing contract “very late in life” – and thus belatedly entering the repertoire of more musicians – Riley’s rhythmically arresting and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=780V-UTppmE\">sometimes jazzy</a> pieces for two pianists were the basis of this spring’s <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5cJY3U9hu3tWBgsi4piWQS\">excellent release</a> by the Zofo duo. Meantime, the Nonesuch label celebrated his 80th birthday by issuing a box set of his opuses, as recorded by the Kronos Quartet (the same group that originally persuaded the composer to re-engage with the string quartet form).</p><p> This weekend in New York, Riley will also help to break in one of Brooklyn’s newest venues: the contemporary-minded National Sawdust. During <a href=\"http://nationalsawdust.org/event/terry-riley-gyan-riley-festival/\">two evening sets</a> on Saturday, he’ll improvise on piano and synthesizer (in the company of his son, the guitarist Gyan Riley). Sunday brings performances of selections from Riley’s “Abbeyozzud” series of guitar works – and, in the late set, a performance of Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band. (That piece is otherwise known as Side B of the iconic 1969 album A Rainbow in Curved Air.) </p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-10-02T21:01:17.843+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The contemporary composer celebrates his 80th birthday this year and shows no sign of slowing down, with a blowout weekend at Brooklyn’s National Sawdust on tap.

All his friends were plumbers, electricians, builders – working class but aspirational, probably what you would these days describe as ‘a bit Ukip’. We didn’t have many books in the house, so I got into music, then started reading the music papers, then started thinking about the ideas behind the music. All the books I read were from namedrops in interviews, people like Camus or Orwell. I studied Russian at university because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/sep/24/author-reputation-dostoevsky\">Dostoevsky</a> was mentioned in a Joy Division tune.”</p><p>The MP for Bristol East is revelling in the strangeness of being asked about something as innocuous as the music she likes. McCarthy’s appointment as shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs during Jeremy Corbyn’s reshuffle was controversial, as she is a dedicated vegan and campaigner for animal welfare. The day after our interview, her comment that “meat should be treated in exactly the same way as tobacco” was pored over by sections of the press.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-10-01T17:33:29.318+01:00","standfirst":"<p>She came to politics via listening to UK Decay and the Specials, and travelled to Russia to see Pussy Riot’s trial.

With the exception of Trevor Horn, they are rarely from the mid-70s to the mid-80s, an era that teemed with back-room boys eager to get their hands on new synth-based gadgetry to create future pop: best of them all was Alan Tarney who, had he worn outsize, red-rimmed glasses and had the owlish presence of Trevor Horn, would be more widely acclaimed.

best","body":"<h2><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJDC3Gg-F8w\">See You Again (Rock Mafia Remix)</a></strong></h2><p>Miley Cyrus was always going to be famous. She was christened Destiny Hope Cyrus because her parents – her dad is former <a href=\"http://cdn.popdust.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/billy-ray-cyrus-hannah-montana-cameo.jpg\">mullet champion</a> Billy Ray Cyrus – believed she would accomplish great things. If that weren’t enough, her godmother is Dolly Parton. After watching a production of Mamma Mia when she was 11, Cyrus decided she wanted to be an actress and landed a minor role in Tim Burton’s Big Fish before fighting her way to the role of Miley Stewart, the pre-teen living a double life as a pop star in the Disney show Hannah Montana. During the course of its five-year run, from 2006 to 2011, Cyrus began releasing music herself, as Hannah Montana, and in summer 2007she was allowed to peek out from behind the curtain on the album <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/23/popandrock.film\">Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus</a>, a sort of Jekyll and Hyde of a double album. The highlight is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJDC3Gg-F8w\">See You Again</a>, which was remixed by Rock Mafia and rereleased as the second single from 2008’s aptly-titled solo album proper, <a href=\"http://www.popmatters.com/review/miley-cyrus-breakout/\">Breakout</a>. Taking the innocence of the Montana creation, and acting as a warning of what’s to come (the song deals with Cyrus being a bit of a mess around boys and at one point she sings: “I have a heart that will never be tamed”), it’s a sugary sweet approximation of the pogoing powerpop that had been pushed to the fore by the likes of Kelly Clarkson and Pink. See You Again’s trump card, apart from the country twang in Cyrus’s voice, is the line she delivers after she’s overcome with shyness in front of a boy. Staring down at her shoes she sings, “My best friend Lesley said, ‘Oh she’s just being Miley.’” It’s an excuse people probably came to use quite a lot in the coming years.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-09-29T17:15:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The woman formerly known as Hannah Montana has released some pearls of pop perfection in an almost decade-long music career, and she’s still only 23</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4cz72","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/755bd438c0e9bf15769027a37d4ae9e1565385ab/0_142_3096_1859/140.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"458069736","byline":"Michael Cragg","internalPageCode":"2379647","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-10-07T00:00:00+01:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/miley-cyrus","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Miley Cyrus","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/miley-cyrus","references":[]},{"id":"music/series/10-of-the-best","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"10 of the best","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/10-of-the-best","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/10-of-the-best","references":[],"description":"Our weekly guide offering you a quick introduction to the most important artists and genres in pop and rock"},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"music/musicblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music blog","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/musicblog","references":[]},{"id":"music/popandrock","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/popandrock","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michaelcragg","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Michael Cragg","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelcragg","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/michaelcragg","references":[],"bio":"<p>Michael Cragg is features editor at <a href=\"http://popjustice.com/\">popjustice.com</a> and writes a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/series/new-music\">daily New Music blog</a> for The Guardian.

Here are the highlights …","headline":"Brian Eno’s John Peel lecture: what we learned","body":"<h2>Breast implants are art. So are apple strudles.</h2><p>Much of Eno’s speech was dedicated to the age-old question: what is art? His answer was nothing if not concise: art is everything that you don’t have to do. To explain this, Eno pointed out that we need to eat, but we don’t need to create a baked alaska. We need to move, but we don’t have to do the rumba, or start twerking (unless you need to rapidly generate some hot takes, that is). So anything that isn’t strictly necessary – from forming a football team to cake decoration via installing silicone implants in your chest – involves a degree of imagination and creativity. And whether rich or poor, we all take part in these artistic activities on a daily basis. Which begs the question why?

Around Christmas, I got all of my jewellery together and I started giving it to people as they were shopping. One of my favourite watches was a rose gold Rolex, and I had that in my inside pocket. I remember somebody talking about ‘time’ and I just reached into my pocket and gave it to them. During that period, I cleared out my entire house, not knowing what I was doing. I lost everything within the space of about four months.”</p><p>Adegbenga Adejumo – Benga, for short – is speaking about the breakdown he experienced two years ago, which led to him being sectioned. An in-demand DJ, producer and member of dance supergroup Magnetic Man, with his Croydon cohorts Skream and Artwork, he announced that he was going into retirement last February to focus on his family. But the 28-year-old dubstep pioneer recently took to Twitter to reveal the real reason he had taken a break. In a series of messages, he opened up about his mental health problems, namely that he was bipolar, which was “brought on by drugs”, and had schizophrenia, “the result of excessive touring”.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-10-03T00:02:38.471+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Last year, the pioneering dubstep DJ and producer was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia.

I remember thinking: ‘Well, if God created music, why is his music in church not as good as this?’”</p><p>You could argue that the particular allure of Nathaniel Rateliff &amp; the Night Sweats’ debut album – not to mention their extraordinary live shows – lies in the pull between the sacred and the secular; the melding of rasping southern soul in the style of Sam &amp; Dave or Otis Redding, with just enough of the Baptist sermon to give Rateliff’s performance a touch of fire and brimstone. “That’s not intentional,” he says. “Because I would want it to feel kinda sexy – but sometimes it feels like a preacher vibe, which is kinda funny.”</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-10-02T12:12:09.289+01:00","standfirst":"<p>The small-town singer has moved from gentle folk to Sam &amp; Dave-inspired anthems.

An extreme strain of heavy metal, it first emerged in the mid-80s with bands such as Bathory, Sarc&oacute;fago and Master’s Hammer, then achieved grim infamy in 90s Norway with the antisocial likes of Mayhem, Burzum and Emperor. Despite spreading among the global underground since, this barbaric image has rather stuck.</p><p>Enter “blackgaze”, the buzz term for a new school of bands taking black metal out of the shadows and melding its blast beats, dungeon wailing and razorwire guitars with the more reflective melodies of post-rock, shoegaze and post-hardcore.

Not only does <em>Unbreakable</em> reunite the singer with Jam &amp; Lewis, the producers of her 80s pomp, the excitably titled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QvdrmRphjc\">Burnitup!</a> finds the lesser-spotted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/missyelliott\">Missy Elliott</a> on board. Modern R&amp;B stars tend to cleave to a narrow set of preoccupations (sex, partying) and sounds, but <em>Unbreakable</em> throws any number of genres, tempos and themes at the wall, united by Jackson’s coo and an over-riding impression of seasoned professionals locked in a groove. There’s plenty of straight-up R&amp;B – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_t0ffY3JvE\">No Sleeep</a>, Dammn Baby and Night find Jam, Lewis and Jackson on nicely updated form – but Lessons Learned, for one, is a country-leaning guitar ballad, one of a large handful of songs about hard-won maturity and making the world a better place that play more to the Oprah demographic.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-10-04T08:03:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>(Sony/BMG)</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4cppm","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/9/30/1443608243187/Janet-Jackson-Miami-001.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"458079666","starRating":"3","byline":"Kitty Empire","internalPageCode":"2380882","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-10-25T11:13:00+00:00"},"tags":[{"id":"music/janet-jackson","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Janet Jackson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/janet-jackson","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/janet-jackson","references":[]},{"id":"music/r-and-b","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"R&B","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/r-and-b","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/r-and-b","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/albumreview","type":"tone","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kittyempire","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Kitty Empire","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kittyempire","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/kittyempire","references":[],"bio":"<p>Kitty Empire is the Observer's pop critic.

The King’s captivation by her was to change the political and religious landscape of England forever. Reformation was brewing, and Henry wanted a son. For Anne, he was willing to divorce his first queen of 24 years, break with Rome and make himself Head of the Church in England, as well as destroy those near and dear to him who dared to stand in his way. But, having achieved his ambitions, and after only three years of marriage, Henry VIII had Anne executed on multiple charges of adultery, including, among the five accused, her brother George Viscount Rochford and lutenist <a href=\"http://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/bios/mark-smeaton/\">Mark Smeaton</a>. Was she guilty? After centuries of debate the jury is still out, and we probably will never know. </p><p>Anne is thought to have been born in the early years of the 16th century, not in her family home at <a href=\"http://www.hevercastle.co.uk/\">Hever Castle</a> as many assume, but in Norfolk, probably in Blickling. In the spring of 1513 she became a maid in honour in the household of <a href=\"http://thefreelancehistorywriter.com/2013/06/28/margaret-of-austria-duchess-of-savoy-and-regent-of-the-netherlands/\">Margaret of Austria</a> (daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I), who was famous for her <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8vJu8gykYUEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Margaret+of+Austria+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=loPr1SHwvr&amp;sig=uTV9RpTyocTFByqmYCph4qRfhJE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwCWoVChMI-I2C5IzvxwIVwW0UCh0c2AsR#v=onepage&amp;q=Margaret%20of%20Austria%20music&amp;f=false\">patronage of musicians</a> and who possessed many important music books. In the following year Anne’s ambitious father arranged her transfer to the French court where she attended Henry VIII’s sister Mary, who was to marry Louis XII. She later served under Mary’s stepdaughter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_of_France\">Queen Claude</a>, with whom she stayed until she was called home to England early in 1522. </p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-10-05T15:41:29.663+01:00","standfirst":"<p>A Tudor songbook with the inscription <em>Mistres ABolleyne nowe thus </em>is believed to have belonged to Anne Boleyn.

While some of the shows have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/04/classicalmusicandopera-jsbach\">designed for touring</a>, the latest, Objects at an Exhibition, was site specific. In collaboration with NMC Records, the orchestra had commissioned six composers to write pieces suggested by exhibits in the <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/\">Science Museum</a> in South Kensington; the results were then given their first performances in situ, as close as possible to the objects that inspired them, in an evening-long event devised by director Tim Hopkins.</p><p>The oldest composer represented is in her 80s, and the youngest in his mid-30s, so the stylistic range was vast. <a href=\"http://www.theamusgrave.com/\">Thea Musgrave</a>’s rather French, rather neoclassical Power Play, conducted by Nicholas Collon among the engines and turbines of the museum’s Energy Hall, was worlds away from <a href=\"http://www.christophermayo.net/\">Christopher Mayo</a>’s Supermarine, inspired by the slate statue of the engineer R J Mitchell in the flight gallery, with cello and double bass punctuating its aero-engine samples. It contrasted, too, with <a href=\"http://www.claudiamolitor.org/\">Claudia Molitor</a>’s rather engaging 2TwoLO, that harks back to the earliest days of radio in the UK, when broadcasting music was forbidden on the fledgling station 2LO, and imagines a way of smuggling a performance (of Handel’s famous Largo) into this music-free zone.<br

The King’s captivation by her was to change the political and religious landscape of England forever. Reformation was brewing, and Henry wanted a son. For Anne, he was willing to divorce his first queen of 24 years, break with Rome and make himself Head of the Church in England, as well as destroy those near and dear to him who dared to stand in his way. But, having achieved his ambitions, and after only three years of marriage, Henry VIII had Anne executed on multiple charges of adultery, including, among the five accused, her brother George Viscount Rochford and lutenist <a href=\"http://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/bios/mark-smeaton/\">Mark Smeaton</a>. Was she guilty?

shadows","body":"<p>Think of black metal and you might envisage a bunch of long-haired satanists caked in corpse paint burning churches and stabbing their bandmates while playing the kind of shrill riffs that can give you heart palpitations. An extreme strain of heavy metal, it first emerged in the mid-80s with bands such as Bathory, Sarc&oacute;fago and Master’s Hammer, then achieved grim infamy in 90s Norway with the antisocial likes of Mayhem, Burzum and Emperor. Despite spreading among the global underground since, this barbaric image has rather stuck.</p><p>Enter “blackgaze”, the buzz term for a new school of bands taking black metal out of the shadows and melding its blast beats, dungeon wailing and razorwire guitars with the more reflective melodies of post-rock, shoegaze and post-hardcore. It’s a geographically loose scene and its bands have been embraced by the indie media, which means you’re now as likely to hear black metal at ATP as in the Carpathian mountains.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-10-05T09:28:23.320+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Once marginalised for being extreme, bands such as Deafheaven are fusing black metal with
